8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,500
GARY GENSLER: All right,
so we're going to try to--

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,450
I was giving a little bit
more time for more people

10
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:29,910
to show up--

11
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,070
chat about what did we
cover this semester.

12
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,010
So I'm going to
try to talk about--

13
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,920
we started out--
money and ledgers,

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,520
and why does that matter, and
if you go away from all this.

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,820
Satoshi Nakamoto's innovation--
what is that again?

16
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,250
The economics of
blockchain technology,

17
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,400
why the financial sector is
so entwined in all of this,

18
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,780
though it's not the
only place we're going.

19
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,790
A little bit about crypto
finance and public policy

20
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:04,680
frameworks, and then wrap
it up with a quote from Ben

21
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,620
Franklin-- will be the last
thing we talk about at the end,

22
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,790
about paying it forward.

23
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,020
I don't know how
many people read

24
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,690
the article I wrote
for Coin Desk, which

25
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,520
will run in a day
or two or something,

26
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:27,430
but that, too, just like helped
me wrap up the whole semester.

27
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:30,670
As I told you, I'm neither a
maximalist or a minimalist,

28
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:32,260
but in a few
minutes, I'm probably

29
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:37,570
going to ask you all to kind of
let me know where you ended up.

30
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:38,860
So the role of money.

31
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,800
Anybody remember
the role of money

32
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,570
in an economy, the three things?

33
00:01:46,432 --> 00:01:48,730
AUDIENCE: Medium of
exchange, unit of account,

34
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:49,990
store of value.

35
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,360
GARY GENSLER: Medium of
exchange, unit of account,

36
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,350
store of value.

37
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,910
I don't think we
really know, when

38
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,360
we go through all the history
and the archeology of it,

39
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,660
which came first, but
all three really matter.

40
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:09,160
So how many people
think that Bitcoin--

41
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,060
just Bitcoin.

42
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,940
I'm not talking about
the other 1,600 tokens--

43
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:20,290
Bitcoin fulfills these
three roles of money?

44
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:21,635
James, was that a hand up?

45
00:02:21,635 --> 00:02:22,260
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

46
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,077
Yep.

47
00:02:23,077 --> 00:02:24,410
GARY GENSLER: You're saying yes.

48
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,815
AUDIENCE: Yes.

49
00:02:25,815 --> 00:02:26,690
GARY GENSLER: Alexis?

50
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:27,420
Oh, we got two.

51
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:27,920
Hugo?

52
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,090
Somebody take the other side.

53
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:33,780
Tom?

54
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,060
AUDIENCE: Nope.

55
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,060
GARY GENSLER: That's it?

56
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:36,560
That's it?

57
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,765
A whole semester, and
all you can say is nope?

58
00:02:38,765 --> 00:02:39,390
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

59
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:39,750
GARY GENSLER: Nope?

60
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,610
All right.

61
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,990
Anybody want to give more?

62
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,446
Brotish?

63
00:02:44,446 --> 00:02:47,740
AUDIENCE: So not a store of
value because of [INAUDIBLE]..

64
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,280
GARY GENSLER: So Brotish
says not a store of value,

65
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,310
but isn't it $60 billion
of value right now?

66
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

67
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:58,610
So there is a value,
but it's too volatile.

68
00:02:58,610 --> 00:02:59,775
GARY GENSLER: James?

69
00:02:59,775 --> 00:03:03,210
AUDIENCE: I
respectfully disagree.

70
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,360
It's volatile when you think
of it in exchange of a dollar,

71
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,940
but if you move your
mindset, a bitcoin

72
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,290
is a bitcoin is a bitcoin.

73
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:10,930
Right?

74
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:15,818
It's only volatile if you
think [INAUDIBLE] a dollar.

75
00:03:15,818 --> 00:03:16,860
GARY GENSLER: Oh, my god.

76
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,050
Here we go.

77
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,480
Ross?

78
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,005
AUDIENCE: But that same
thing is true of corn, right?

79
00:03:23,005 --> 00:03:24,680
A bushel of corn is--

80
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,722
I'm with Brotish on this.

81
00:03:25,722 --> 00:03:27,097
GARY GENSLER: I'm
sorry, were you

82
00:03:27,097 --> 00:03:28,920
in the no camp or the yes camp?

83
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,150
That it's a store of value.

84
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,230
AUDIENCE: I'm in the no camp.

85
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:31,938
GARY GENSLER: No?

86
00:03:31,938 --> 00:03:33,240
Is it a medium of exchange?

87
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,050
AUDIENCE: Yes.

88
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,290
GARY GENSLER: Oh,
medium of exchange.

89
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:35,800
Sean?

90
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,895
AUDIENCE: In response
to [INAUDIBLE] none

91
00:03:39,895 --> 00:03:41,520
of the currency can
actually be treated

92
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,670
as a stand alone currency.

93
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,780
Everything has to be
treated as a pair.

94
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,460
So everything's a
relative comparison.

95
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:51,720
So you can't really treat
Bitcoin on a standalone basis.

96
00:03:55,457 --> 00:03:57,290
AUDIENCE: I don't know
if I agree with that.

97
00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:00,180
But I would say that pretty much
anything can fit into all three

98
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,000
of these buckets.

99
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,430
It just depends on
how dependable it is.

100
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,700
In those three buckets,
with US dollar's

101
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,710
very good at being
medium of exchange,

102
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,690
very good at being a
dependable store of value,

103
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,490
and a steady unit of account.

104
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:16,867
But you could also have a
bushel of wheat or something.

105
00:04:16,867 --> 00:04:18,450
It would be all three
of these things,

106
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:19,320
but it wouldn't be equality.

107
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,550
GARY GENSLER: Right, but--

108
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,519
please, Jihee.

109
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,860
AUDIENCE: So the fiat
currency-- the reason why

110
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,910
I think US dollar is
stable is because there

111
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,650
is a US central bank that
actually backs up that.

112
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,450
Because it's just
that fiat currency.

113
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:36,900
It is a liability
of the central bank,

114
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,998
whereas Bitcoin
doesn't have a center

115
00:04:40,998 --> 00:04:42,040
to worry that banks have.

116
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,774
GARY GENSLER: Nice music
that we're getting.

117
00:04:43,774 --> 00:04:44,710
[INAUDIBLE] a serenade.

118
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,252
AUDIENCE: So therefore,
I don't think

119
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:48,363
the store of value
argument will work.

120
00:04:48,363 --> 00:04:49,530
GARY GENSLER: So you think--

121
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,905
[INAUDIBLE] saying,
well, there's

122
00:04:50,905 --> 00:04:54,310
no central bank behind it,
so maybe it doesn't hold up.

123
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:57,120
But if you take anything
away from the class--

124
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,630
and I'm going to have
some other takeaways, too.

125
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:04,470
Remember, the three things
that about the role of money--

126
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,870
but it's a social construct.

127
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,430
Even with a central bank--

128
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:11,970
a central bank is, ultimately--
we enshrined in law.

129
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:15,420
We enshrine it in a big
institution, and bricks,

130
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,770
and mortar, and columns usually.

131
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:21,520
You always have to
have those columns.

132
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,750
But it's still a
social construct.

133
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:32,160
And Bitcoin does, in some
ways, have all three of these.

134
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,260
It's just not
broadly acceptable.

135
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:37,030
It's rarely used as
a unit of account,

136
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,390
but it is sometimes
used as a unit account

137
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:42,100
in some initial coin offerings.

138
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,180
It's not used, generally,
as a medium of exchange.

139
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,460
But some people are
paid in Bitcoin some.

140
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:53,010
Software developers are
actually paid in Bitcoin.

141
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:54,030
And it's $60 billion.

142
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,440
It might be volatile.

143
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,460
It has a store value.

144
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,900
So I'm not trying to take
maximalist or minimalist,

145
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,660
but I'm probably
between Tom and James,

146
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,290
because it does have
all of those qualities

147
00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:12,390
in to some extent in there.

148
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:16,440
Early money-- remember some
of our walk down memory lane.

149
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:22,620
Some of these early monies
fell apart, became extinct,

150
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,428
when they got debased.

151
00:06:24,428 --> 00:06:26,220
And we talked about,
early in the semester,

152
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,900
even the story about it.

153
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,990
It was, I think, a British--

154
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,960
when the British got
to the island of Yap,

155
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,900
they went off a couple miles
and quarried the stones

156
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,450
and kept bringing
more yap stones there.

157
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,240
And all of a sudden,
it got debased.

158
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,710
And then, of course, money
turned to paper money.

159
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,950
And in the bottom
left-hand corner,

160
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,730
it started as
warehouse receipts.

161
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:53,040
So the paper was
just a representation

162
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,630
of the store of value--

163
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:59,310
the metal, or the corn, or
the wheat that we had earlier.

164
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:02,460
Another important
thing was ledgers.

165
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,930
Who wants to remind the
class what a ledger is?

166
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:08,510
Why do ledgers matter?

167
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,310
Anybody want to-- ledgers?

168
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:13,865
All right, clearly I
didn't make it on ledgers.

169
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:18,605
Hugo?

170
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:21,780
AUDIENCE: It's transaction
history, basically.

171
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,630
GARY GENSLER: A store
transaction history.

172
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:26,620
What else is there?

173
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,460
AUDIENCE: Balances.

174
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,312
GARY GENSLER: Balances of?

175
00:07:29,312 --> 00:07:30,640
AUDIENCE: Accounts.

176
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,810
GARY GENSLER: Accounts.

177
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,420
So it stores a balance
and a transaction.

178
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,980
So you can think of it
as a flow and a balance.

179
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,510
The flow is the transaction--

180
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:43,380
I give Hugo money.

181
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,470
Regardless of who gives Hugo
money, here's his balance.

182
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:49,410
So an income statement
and a balance sheet

183
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:51,210
is a flow and a balance.

184
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:57,440
But ledgers and keeping ledgers
go back thousands of years.

185
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,550
So blockchain technology
is really about money,

186
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,860
but it's also about a
database that has ledgers.

187
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,750
And ledgers usually
store things of value.

188
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,130
So then we got to fiat currency.

189
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:11,460
And fiat currency,
as Jihee said,

190
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,440
they were represented by
central bank notes, central bank

191
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,285
reserves, and bank deposits.

192
00:08:16,285 --> 00:08:17,800
So there's three things.

193
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,950
Does anybody want
to see if anybody

194
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:22,480
listened in those classes?

195
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,130
[LAUGHS] I'm kidding around.

196
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,680
Elan, you're going to say,
why is it those three things?

197
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,872
They're all forms of fiat money.

198
00:08:29,872 --> 00:08:31,330
AUDIENCE: I thought
you were asking

199
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:34,950
about the illicit
activity in that list.

200
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:35,980
Is that the question?

201
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,480
GARY GENSLER: All right,
answer the question

202
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,340
you want to answer.

203
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:38,965
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

204
00:08:38,965 --> 00:08:39,960
[LAUGHTER]

205
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,335
[INAUDIBLE] there
are things that

206
00:08:41,335 --> 00:08:45,466
are important in fiat
currency, or is helpful.

207
00:08:45,466 --> 00:08:50,440
Fiat currency is important
for paying taxes.

208
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:56,230
And it is allegedly backed
by the social understanding

209
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:00,707
that the central bank will
respect those notes at the end.

210
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:01,540
GARY GENSLER: Right.

211
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,850
So it's actually--
you're on to this.

212
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,130
It's accepted for taxes.

213
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,330
It's legal tender.

214
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:09,283
So actually, society
gets together,

215
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:11,200
through its parliament,
through its executive,

216
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,740
and passes a law that
says it's legal tender.

217
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,280
That gives it a huge leg up.

218
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,440
But this is what
it's really about.

219
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,900
It has huge network effects.

220
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,890
And I wrote this in
the CoinDesk article.

221
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:26,440
The question I have
for any new currency

222
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,780
is, how does it compete with
those incredible network

223
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,250
effects?

224
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,400
And we talk about Facebook
has incredible network effects

225
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,510
because--

226
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,400
two billion members.

227
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,880
But even money, as a
technology, has a network effect

228
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,090
because people readily accept
it as a unit of account,

229
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:47,480
a medium of exchange,
a store of value.

230
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,200
And it only loses that
network effect, usually,

231
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,050
when it gets
debased, when people

232
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,840
can't be confident that
it's a good store of value

233
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,240
because somebody else
can mint a lot of it,

234
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:06,170
or print a lot of it, or a king
starts to print too much of it.

235
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:09,380
But it has an extraordinary
network effect.

236
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:11,030
On the other hand,
sometimes currencies

237
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,850
are a little bit challenged,
like the euro right now.

238
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,930
Will the euro ultimately work?

239
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,230
That's for a different class
and a different lecture,

240
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:21,650
but will the euro
ultimately work long term?

241
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:26,300
I have my doubts whether it
will work for decades to come,

242
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,620
because there's so
many jurisdictions.

243
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,230
And there's not a
unified fiscal account,

244
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:40,790
not a unified economy, and not
truly free movement of labor

245
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:44,850
across that continent.

246
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,590
So that's fiat currency.

247
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:50,970
It's sort of the game in town
that then Satoshi Nakamoto

248
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:53,070
is was addressing.

249
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,900
And you all read the
eight-page paper,

250
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,540
but that was the first line.

251
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,218
"Been working on a
new electronic cash

252
00:10:59,218 --> 00:11:01,260
system that's fully
peer-to-peer, with no trusted

253
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,280
third party."

254
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,470
Basically, as Jihee
said, no central bank.

255
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:06,450
Forget about that central bank.

256
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:12,000
That was the core
inspiration that was there.

257
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,180
But interestingly, it
wasn't the first try.

258
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,160
And we talked early
in the semester

259
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,730
about at least a handful
of early attempts

260
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:24,400
that all failed
because they were still

261
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:29,320
centralized-- like DigiCash
was still very centralized.

262
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,870
Or they couldn't solve
the double spending.

263
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:34,510
On the internet, you
can send an email twice.

264
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,090
It doesn't need a
central authority.

265
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,620
So what if it gets copied?

266
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:42,140
But the double spending
is the big issue.

267
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:47,940
So how did he solve
it, or she solve it?

268
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:52,060
Does anybody still not know
who Satoshi Nakamoto is?

269
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:52,560
No?

270
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,820
All right.

271
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,290
I was hoping, I was hoping.

272
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:04,160
So we talked about
blocks of data

273
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,655
using cryptography
and consensus.

274
00:12:08,655 --> 00:12:10,280
So if you're at a
dinner party, and you

275
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,767
can't remember anything else
from this class, [LAUGHS]

276
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:15,350
maybe just remember,
oh, yeah, there's

277
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:19,570
something about blocks of data
using a bunch of cryptography

278
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,560
and consensus.

279
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,910
These slides are on Canvas.

280
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:26,350
Download this one slide,
you're the expert.

281
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,745
Neha Nerula actually
created this slide,

282
00:12:28,745 --> 00:12:32,060
and I've been using it a lot.

283
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,420
But anybody remember who
invented this whole concept

284
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,550
of blocks of data?

285
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:40,470
James?

286
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,640
AUDIENCE: Adam someone?

287
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,140
Back?

288
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,765
GARY GENSLER: Adam
Back is a good name,

289
00:12:43,765 --> 00:12:46,140
but he's not the guy
that invented this.

290
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:49,972
He invented something else,
which was proof-of-work.

291
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,600
Timestamp append-only
logs-- what's

292
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,840
the longest running
blockchain in the world?

293
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,100
AUDIENCE: New York Times?

294
00:12:59,100 --> 00:12:59,655
GARY GENSLER: New York Times.

295
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:00,600
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

296
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,433
AUDIENCE: Crossword.

297
00:13:01,433 --> 00:13:05,700
GARY GENSLER: All
right, here he is.

298
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:10,480
So two Bell Labs scientists--
this is one of them.

299
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,560
Two Bell Labs scientists
came up with this concept

300
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,000
that you could take a bunch
of data, put it through what's

301
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,320
called a cryptographic
hash function,

302
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,637
and that's a commitment scheme.

303
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,970
You couldn't change it, because
if you changed anything,

304
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:30,360
the hash function would change.

305
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,430
So what's a cryptographic
hash function?

306
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:34,350
That's when I use
this idea of you

307
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:37,080
can take the entire
library of Congress,

308
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,780
and put it into a little
thing called a hash function,

309
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:45,150
and end up with a
string of characters,

310
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:52,280
a hexadecimal output.

311
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:59,790
But a hash function is the key
to what this guy figured out.

312
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,660
And, of course, this.

313
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,370
That's the key.

314
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:06,890
There was only two
bits of cryptography

315
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:08,660
in this whole class.

316
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:12,710
And I know that it seemed like,
oh, why are we teaching this?

317
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:15,870
But it's this idea that you
can take a whole bunch of data,

318
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,810
put it into this thing
called a hash function,

319
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:19,340
and it commits to it.

320
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:22,520
Because if you change
any piece of the data--

321
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,700
any individual
piece-- you're going

322
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:28,380
to get a different output.

323
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:32,928
And so it's really the key to
it is that it commits something.

324
00:14:32,928 --> 00:14:35,220
You can do it with the New
York Times crossword puzzle,

325
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:41,490
and that was just my
observation on it.

326
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,380
So it's about data commitment.

327
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,860
The other thing that
Satoshi Nakamoto used

328
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:51,750
was asymmetric cryptography,
or digital signatures.

329
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:54,660
I pulled one of the graphics
that we talked about.

330
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:59,850
But the idea being that,
long ago, cryptography

331
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,980
was, how do I encrypt
something because I'm

332
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,910
in a military campaign?

333
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,520
And I would, maybe,
just transpose.

334
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,550
The simplest cryptography
from thousands of years

335
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:13,550
ago was transposing
every letter.

336
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:16,130
An A becomes a B,
a B becomes a C.

337
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,740
That would be a
transposition of one.

338
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:23,640
Well, that's pretty hard to
imagine that anybody got away

339
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,140
with that.

340
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,990
But that was early cryptography,
thousands of years ago-- just

341
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:29,780
simple transposition.

342
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,330
By the mid-20th
century, there was

343
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:35,150
very complex
transpositions, which

344
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:38,240
were called keys and enigma.

345
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,900
If you ever go back and watch
that movie Imitation Games,

346
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,110
there was five metal rotors--

347
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,910
they were electronic rotors--

348
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,160
that changed.

349
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:54,110
And every day, the Germans
would change the five rotors.

350
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,900
But still, they were
symmetric cryptography.

351
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:02,900
The U boats actually
had the same five rotors

352
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,440
as high command out of--

353
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,070
Berlin, let's say.

354
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:11,510
So somebody came
along in the 1970s

355
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,220
and said, what if
the key is different?

356
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,210
It's asymmetric.

357
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:16,140
There's a private
key, and a public key.

358
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:21,550
The public key, everybody gets,
but the private key, you keep.

359
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,800
And some of those
computer sites--

360
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,680
cryptographers-- are
here, right here, at MIT.

361
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,730
Ron Rivest teaches a
course in cryptography.

362
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:34,440
But that invention, in
the 1970s, is really key.

363
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,520
So it's hash functions,
and this concept

364
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,110
of a private key
and a public key,

365
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:42,500
and of course a digital
signature that goes with it.

366
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,040
You probably don't even need to
remember much about this class

367
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:46,557
about this.

368
00:16:46,557 --> 00:16:48,140
But just know there's
something called

369
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,810
a private key and a public key.

370
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:54,740
And then, Nakamoto's
real innovation

371
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,480
was off of Adam Back.

372
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,340
And Adam Back said, if I use
some computational work--

373
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:05,210
if I use computational work
to find a hash function that

374
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:08,930
has a predetermined
number of zeros,

375
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,310
it's not much of a puzzle.

376
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,380
It's a random number generation.

377
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,099
People will say proof-of-work
is a computational puzzle.

378
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:19,150
It is simply running--

379
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,770
this thing called mining
is running-- electricity

380
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:24,454
until you get the right
number of leading zeros.

381
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,270
But it can be
efficiently verified.

382
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:32,810
So the characteristics of
proof-of-work is of work is--

383
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,760
invented in 1997.

384
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,360
Blockchains were
invented in 1991.

385
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:40,700
But what Satoshi Nakamoto--

386
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:45,500
what she did was she pulled that
together after like 20 or 30

387
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:50,180
failed attempts to have a
digital, non-central money

388
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:53,930
and said, that that's where
blockchain inspiration is.

389
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:59,200
And so proof of work--

390
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,650
I use this little visual.

391
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:06,430
But each block-- do you
remember what the word nonce is?

392
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:07,760
What's a nonce?

393
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,350
Ross?

394
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,000
Make me proud, somebody.

395
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,665
Can't remember.

396
00:18:13,665 --> 00:18:14,467
AUDIENCE: And once.

397
00:18:14,467 --> 00:18:15,550
GARY GENSLER: What's that?

398
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,930
AUDIENCE: And once.

399
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,865
GARY GENSLER: And
once-- a number once.

400
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:19,990
AUDIENCE: Number used once.

401
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:20,668
AUDIENCE: Once.

402
00:18:20,668 --> 00:18:21,960
GARY GENSLER: Number used once.

403
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:28,070
And so why is a nonce
important for proof of work?

404
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,800
AUDIENCE: Because
it's a unique number.

405
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,450
GARY GENSLER: It's
a unique number.

406
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:34,810
AUDIENCE: And so
establishing the integrity

407
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:35,920
of that [INAUDIBLE].

408
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,200
GARY GENSLER: So all this
whole proof of work--

409
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,930
I'm just going back as a review,
but the whole proof of work

410
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:43,930
is your computer is
going to randomly keep

411
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:47,080
picking one thing that changes.

412
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,630
All the data, all the
transactions are the same,

413
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:53,730
but keep changing this
thing called a nonce

414
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:58,320
until I get some
leading number of zeros.

415
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,740
And the whole Bitcoin
network around the globe--

416
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,860
all it's really doing is running
a random number generation,

417
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:09,180
or nonces, until
the hash function

418
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:13,600
is solved to have 18
leading zeros right now.

419
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,950
Or I should say--

420
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:20,668
18 leading zeros when Bitcoin's
value was $6,500 a Bitcoin.

421
00:19:20,668 --> 00:19:22,210
It wouldn't surprise
me if it's going

422
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:26,190
to fall down to 17 leading
zeros, or 16 leading zeros,

423
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:28,860
because that would
make it easier to find.

424
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:36,690
All of that cryptography is just
to make the database structure.

425
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:42,290
This database structure
that is in blockchain--

426
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,560
to make this work.

427
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,860
All that cryptography of hash
functions, digital signatures,

428
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,440
and a little proof
of work is to make it

429
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,010
what's called nearly immutable.

430
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:55,590
And I'm putting the word
"nearly" in because nothing's

431
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,590
truly immutable.

432
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:00,770
You could overwhelm even
the Bitcoin network.

433
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:04,745
Questions about the technology?

434
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:05,430
[INAUDIBLE]

435
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,930
AUDIENCE: Could you just go
over the number of leading zeros

436
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,510
concept again?

437
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:15,800
GARY GENSLER: So the concept
behind the proof of work

438
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:25,560
that Adam Back came up with
in the late 1990s was--

439
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:30,780
gotta run some data
through a hash function.

440
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:34,020
In his case, in Adam
Back's case, it was emails.

441
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:39,030
Literally run an email all the
way through a hash function,

442
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:42,810
and then add an additional
bit of data to it--

443
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:46,930
this nonce, a number
that's used once--

444
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:51,890
and run that nonce randomly
until the hash that comes out.

445
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,700
And my little
visual at the bottom

446
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,790
there has some
leading zeros to it.

447
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,360
AUDIENCE: So
beginning of the hash

448
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,610
will be its number of zeros?

449
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:04,360
GARY GENSLER: Yes.

450
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,350
So in this case,
four leading zeros--

451
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,790
in that little visual there.

452
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:12,280
All the data that
goes into a block--

453
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:16,960
in Bitcoin, 1,000 to 1,500
transactions all go in.

454
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,360
They're rolled up in this
thing called a Merkle tree,

455
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,700
but it all goes in.

456
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,440
And the only thing
that's changing

457
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,580
is the miners are trying
to find a random nonce

458
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:33,810
until the hash has certain
number of leading zeros.

459
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:38,580
When Nakamoto wrote the paper,
the difficulty was, I think,

460
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:40,630
10 leading zeros.

461
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:43,815
And you could solve
that on a laptop.

462
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,280
With eight more leading zeros--

463
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,320
and since it's hexadecimal--

464
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,700
I guess it's 16 to
the eighth power

465
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:04,477
harder, or something like
seven trillion times harder.

466
00:22:04,477 --> 00:22:05,060
AUDIENCE: Yes.

467
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,580
AUDIENCE: Let's assume
that you and I were trying

468
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,640
to have a transaction today.

469
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,849
And I'm going to
keep some coins.

470
00:22:18,849 --> 00:22:22,060
And I'm [INAUDIBLE]
these for everyone

471
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,120
who's transacting
many, many times

472
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:30,370
and adding layers of difficulty
to the transaction that we had.

473
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:35,210
If I want to use my
balance in five years,

474
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:37,800
how do we know
what my balance is?

475
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,000
I need to go back
through all the history

476
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,250
to know that I have a balance?

477
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:47,350
GARY GENSLER: So at the heart
of the blockchain technology,

478
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:50,410
the Bitcoin network, but
also all the other networks,

479
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:54,130
is the entire transaction
history is public.

480
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:56,230
This both gives us its
strength, but it's also

481
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:58,870
one of its challenges.

482
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:02,470
And so, yes, even
five years from now,

483
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:08,300
if you want to use
one of your Bitcoins--

484
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,680
which are stored
on the blockchain--

485
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,890
you have to be able to show
that here is a transaction

486
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:16,390
output from five years ago.

487
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:21,710
If you remember, there is both
transaction output models--

488
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:26,480
Bitcoin is a system that keeps
all the individual transactions

489
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,780
in a set called the UTXO--

490
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:32,920
the Unspent
Transaction Output Set.

491
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:37,300
You'd have to be able to show
that you have that in 25 years,

492
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,050
you said?

493
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:44,200
2023-- in 2023, you'd have
to be able to show that.

494
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,810
AUDIENCE: So it's
also a balance.

495
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:51,260
They all spent this balance
in the transaction [INAUDIBLE]

496
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,060
a record.

497
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,270
GARY GENSLER: It is
a record of an output

498
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:57,830
from an individual transaction.

499
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:01,620
So yes, it is like a balance.

500
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:07,610
But because Bitcoin does not
add up all of those individual--

501
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:12,410
if you had 13
individual outputs,

502
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:16,450
the Bitcoin network will
not add up those 13.

503
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:21,226
You'd have to use each of those
individually as new inputs.

504
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:26,170
AUDIENCE: And that one is
on the last block, as well.

505
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:28,627
But I'd have to go
back [INAUDIBLE]..

506
00:24:28,627 --> 00:24:30,460
GARY GENSLER: All right,
so the question is,

507
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,600
does the last block--

508
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,190
Bitcoin has 550-some 1,000
blocks of data right now.

509
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:40,040
Does the last block
store all of the data?

510
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:45,710
And the answer is, no, but
it does store a hash function

511
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:49,160
from the previous block,
which stores a hash function

512
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,100
from the previous block.

513
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:57,450
So your transaction output might
be on block number 420,000,

514
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:01,760
130,000 blocks ago.

515
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,430
But what shows that
it's verifiable

516
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:08,480
is that each one of these blocks
are linked to another block

517
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,460
through this thing called
a commitment scheme

518
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,790
called a hash function.

519
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:17,120
So technically speaking,
the latest block

520
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,870
has a number in it--

521
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:22,750
a hexadecimal number,
but a number in it--

522
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:25,660
called a hash function
that is committed to.

523
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:28,870
Because all the data
that's come before it--

524
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:31,770
all the millions of
transactions before it--

525
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:34,060
if somebody even
changes one of them,

526
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:37,672
you'll know that
it's been tampered.

527
00:25:37,672 --> 00:25:41,460
AUDIENCE: Let's say I want
to use that balance I have.

528
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:45,500
Where do the blockchain
verify that I have that?

529
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,180
Is it on the last
block, or does it

530
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:53,495
go back as long as it
finds the [INAUDIBLE]??

531
00:25:53,495 --> 00:25:54,870
GARY GENSLER: In
essence, it does

532
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:59,420
both, because the last
block better be valid.

533
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,450
But for you to
spend something, it

534
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:10,180
has to really go back and find
that the input that you now

535
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:15,420
want to use is an output
that has not yet been spent.

536
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:18,570
Eric, did you have something
that you were trying to--

537
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:21,660
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it was
a very nice explanation.

538
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,780
You have to go all the way
where your transaction-- where

539
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:29,365
you got the Bitcoin
was, whatever

540
00:26:29,365 --> 00:26:32,225
block it is [INAUDIBLE]
through the blockchain.

541
00:26:32,225 --> 00:26:35,470
If you would try
to get those coins

542
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:41,160
and use them as a [INAUDIBLE]
for whatever transaction

543
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,045
you want to do, you have
to go all the way back.

544
00:26:44,045 --> 00:26:45,420
GARY GENSLER: And
this complexity

545
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,310
is part of the
reason why it doesn't

546
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,110
have the same performance--

547
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:53,130
doesn't have the same
scalability-- yet.

548
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:56,550
I'm one that believes in a--

549
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:59,100
I'm optimistic that some
of these scalability

550
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,230
and performance issues
will be overcome.

551
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:04,050
But it might take three,
five, seven years.

552
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:07,513
And it's not three
or seven months.

553
00:27:07,513 --> 00:27:09,180
But you're absolutely
right, because you

554
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:12,210
have to kind of look back--

555
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,240
way back.

556
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,860
The Ethereum network doesn't
just do it on transactions.

557
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,838
It has balances.

558
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:21,880
And so it's a little bit
more efficient that way,

559
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,650
and has other inefficiencies--

560
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:30,450
many other big inefficiencies,
but in some ways it--

561
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:32,100
We talked about smart contracts.

562
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:36,360
Larry Lessig actually spoke to
us also about smart contracts.

563
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,970
Nick Szabo wrote
about this in 1996.

564
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:40,980
I like to talk about
the history to say,

565
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,670
it's not all about this one
person that we don't know--

566
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,460
Satoshi Nakamoto--
but a set of promises

567
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:50,550
specified in digital form,
including protocols, where

568
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:52,380
parties keep their promises.

569
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,170
Think about it as a
modern way to automate.

570
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:57,375
So if you're out in
business in the future,

571
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:59,250
you're thinking about
investing, and somebody

572
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:02,700
raises a smart contract issue.

573
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,447
Even if you're a
Bitcoin minimalist,

574
00:28:05,447 --> 00:28:06,780
you might say, wait, wait, wait.

575
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,000
There might be some
way I can automate

576
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,570
that which is currently
done by lawyers,

577
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:17,375
or by back-office
folks, or accountants.

578
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:18,750
So there's still
something there.

579
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:21,420
And we talked about a
use case where the SDA--

580
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:25,260
the Swap Derivatives
Association--

581
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,270
is looking at smart
contracts to try

582
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:34,970
to automate some of the
previously written mechanisms.

583
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:38,590
So smart contracts,
which have come out

584
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:43,480
of this whole blockchain
technology movement,

585
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,083
actually predates
blockchain technology.

586
00:28:46,083 --> 00:28:48,250
But blockchain technology,
again, as well-- maybe we

587
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:53,780
can do this in a verifiable,
nearly immutable way, as well.

588
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:56,800
So moving value or
automating some forms

589
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,070
of contractual arrangement.

590
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,950
But remember,
they're not so smart,

591
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:05,670
and they're not
so much contracts.

592
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:07,510
You probably still
need the courts,

593
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:09,490
and there's still some
ambiguity that can't

594
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:12,790
be pushed into these documents.

595
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,710
So then, we talked a
lot about the economics

596
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:16,630
of blockchain technology.

597
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:21,040
And it's around verification
costs and networking costs.

598
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,350
But it's about lowering
verification costs.

599
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,910
And some of those
verification costs

600
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:28,060
might just be the economic
rents of the current incumbents.

601
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:32,230
So blockchain technology may
be a really important way

602
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:37,630
to lower direct verification
costs and deal with censorship.

603
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:40,810
And I think that was a lot of
what Nakamoto's innovation was

604
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:42,850
about, was dealing with
censorship that somebody

605
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:45,400
could deny me the right
to use my money when

606
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,410
I want to use my money.

607
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,810
But it could also be about
lowering economic rents.

608
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,142
Any questions?

609
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:59,580
And then we said, how do
you assess a use case?

610
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:04,080
And this was at the core of
even my CoinDesk article.

611
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,500
Before you get to anything
else is, how is it going to be,

612
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,150
really?

613
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:10,140
It's what's the value
creation proposition?

614
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,900
Again, what are the verification
and networking costs that

615
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,710
are really going to be reduced?

616
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:16,650
And what are competitors doing?

617
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,420
With a keen eye on--

618
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:21,810
in trade finance,
there's 20 or 30 efforts,

619
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:24,390
so it's worthwhile
looking at those 20 or 30.

620
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:30,360
I don't know which
field you all go into,

621
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,940
but if you're in a field where
nobody has used blockchain

622
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,910
technology, no competitor,
then ask the question,

623
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:40,290
well, how are competitors
using traditional databases?

624
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:43,340
And that might be the
opportunity for you.

625
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,350
And it might be a
golden opportunity.

626
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:48,660
But always look-- what's
the value proposition?

627
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,760
What verification
and networking cost?

628
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,260
What's the competition?

629
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:58,273
And then, you get into
the sort of tough details.

630
00:30:58,273 --> 00:30:59,690
And if you're
investing, if you're

631
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:01,400
a venture capitalist
and somebody

632
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,210
can't really tell you why
multiple stakeholders need

633
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:08,870
to write to the ledger,
and what's their data--

634
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:11,780
what data are they going to
be storing on this append-only

635
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,380
log--

636
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:17,520
then I might suggest you
invest in something else.

637
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,270
I mean, you can always
invest in something

638
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:22,720
because you think that
it's a momentum play.

639
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,140
And if you invest, it's
an early seed investment,

640
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:28,108
and somebody will bail you out.

641
00:31:28,108 --> 00:31:29,650
But most venture
capitalists-- you're

642
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:33,380
investing for three to six
years, or three to five years.

643
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,350
And so I wouldn't
always expect somebody

644
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,220
is going to bail you out.

645
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,590
Ask the tough questions.

646
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:39,382
Jihee?

647
00:31:39,382 --> 00:31:41,590
AUDIENCE: But just because
that is the best solution,

648
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:45,220
it doesn't mean that they're
going to be successful later,

649
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,030
right?

650
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:51,280
There are multiple examples
of products, or services,

651
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,830
or [INAUDIBLE] that are
clearly not the best solution

652
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:57,760
but have taken dominant
position in a market.

653
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:03,610
So I was curious, should
it be the best solution?

654
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:07,710
GARY GENSLER: Well, I think
that's one of the questions.

655
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:10,605
But you're saying, well, what
if it's not the best solution?

656
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:17,140
Going back to what
Jeff Sprecher said,

657
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:23,050
can it do something
cheaper, faster, or better?

658
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:25,468
And it might not be
the best solution.

659
00:32:25,468 --> 00:32:27,260
But if it can at least
answer the question,

660
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:32,310
is it cheaper,
better, or faster,

661
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:34,380
you're probably not
going to be successful.

662
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:37,070
And in some cases, it's
not the best data solution,

663
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:40,380
but there's such
high economic rents

664
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,980
that however the mortgage
product, the health care

665
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,230
product, the product that
is being delivered now,

666
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:49,080
the payment solution
that you're saying, ah,

667
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,290
it's not the best solution.

668
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:53,910
But this is my solution on how
I'm going to do it cheaper,

669
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:57,000
because they have so
many economic rents.

670
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,760
So maybe that the
word should say,

671
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,900
why is this a better solution,
rather than best solution.

672
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,294
I'll agree with that.

673
00:33:06,294 --> 00:33:07,890
Other queries?

674
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:13,550
And then, if there's
a native token,

675
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:16,490
I think that's where
you start to lose May.

676
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:19,850
But now, I'm going
to ask the class.

677
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:23,030
How many people have come
out of this semester thinking

678
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:26,450
there's a lot of
initial coin offerings

679
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:29,978
that you'd want to
personally invest in?

680
00:33:29,978 --> 00:33:31,320
[LAUGHTER]

681
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,590
All right, is there
anybody in the class

682
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:38,340
that owns an initial coin
offering-- a non-Bitcoin token?

683
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:42,741
OK, do you want to tell us why?

684
00:33:42,741 --> 00:33:44,330
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

685
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:48,830
GARY GENSLER: Give us the value
proposition, or the pitch.

686
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:52,710
AUDIENCE: So I went to work
for a startup, [INAUDIBLE]

687
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:53,780
this summer.

688
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:57,050
And after the summer,
they paid me US dollars.

689
00:33:57,050 --> 00:34:01,930
But after the summer, they gave
me a lot of tokens they have.

690
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:03,520
And I saved a
little bit of them.

691
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,520
GARY GENSLER: All right.

692
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,380
So you got paid in tokens.

693
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:09,030
AUDIENCE: No, I was
paid in US dollars.

694
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:12,400
After the summer, they
gave me most of the--

695
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:16,030
like a bunch of--
some of the tokens.

696
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,409
GARY GENSLER: As a bonus or?

697
00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:18,040
AUDIENCE: As a bonus, yeah.

698
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:18,360
GARY GENSLER: I see.

699
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,659
As a bonus, you got--

700
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:20,170
all right.

701
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:21,610
And you sold some of them?

702
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,260
AUDIENCE: Some of
them, sold them.

703
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,429
GARY GENSLER: And I see.

704
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,270
AUDIENCE: Some of them
I still [INAUDIBLE]..

705
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:27,270
GARY GENSLER: All right.

706
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:32,300
And do you think that there's
a use for these native tokens?

707
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,726
AUDIENCE: This specific startup?

708
00:34:33,726 --> 00:34:34,704
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

709
00:34:34,704 --> 00:34:35,980
Names will not be repeated.

710
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,912
It's being filmed.

711
00:34:36,912 --> 00:34:37,870
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

712
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:38,995
GARY GENSLER: I don't know.

713
00:34:38,995 --> 00:34:39,760
Sean.

714
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,739
AUDIENCE: So I
thought of it-- well,

715
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:44,520
I just thought a little
of like Tron, which is a--

716
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,159
GARY GENSLER: Tron.

717
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,409
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's a gaming.

718
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:48,820
GARY GENSLER: Gaming site.

719
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,850
AUDIENCE: Which is a--
basically a company

720
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:52,460
started by a friend of mine.

721
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,980
So it's kind of a
token of support

722
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,219
instead of like [INAUDIBLE].

723
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:56,219
GARY GENSLER: All right.

724
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:59,020
So you bought some tokens
as a token of support

725
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:01,630
for a friend, who
started a company.

726
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:04,330
Do you think they have some use?

727
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:05,740
Can you use the token?

728
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,778
AUDIENCE: I don't
think there's-- well--

729
00:35:07,778 --> 00:35:09,260
[LAUGHTER]

730
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,800
Well, it's supposed to be the--

731
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,885
building up to the biggest
gaming network [INAUDIBLE]..

732
00:35:14,885 --> 00:35:16,510
GARY GENSLER: But is
it pre-functional,

733
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,205
or is it functional?

734
00:35:18,205 --> 00:35:19,790
It's pre-functional.

735
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:20,680
Hugo?

736
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,575
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

737
00:35:21,575 --> 00:35:22,950
GARY GENSLER: You
have-- you are?

738
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,330
AUDIENCE: I have-- yeah.

739
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,330
GARY GENSLER: All right.

740
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:26,247
You don't-- all right.

741
00:35:26,247 --> 00:35:27,520
He's got a whole portfolio.

742
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,842
I can tell.

743
00:35:28,842 --> 00:35:29,800
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

744
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,862
I've been interested in
this for over a year now.

745
00:35:32,862 --> 00:35:34,320
So I wanted to make
a whole radical

746
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,612
of like, oh, this one looks
like it's going to go well,

747
00:35:36,612 --> 00:35:37,680
but this one's a scam.

748
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:44,810
And there are some that seem
like sure-- in the long run,

749
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:47,760
they may retain some value.

750
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,967
But I probably made
some bad investments.

751
00:35:49,967 --> 00:35:50,800
GARY GENSLER: Right.

752
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,340
So I don't want to make you sort
of grieve those bad investment

753
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:57,820
decisions, but are any of
your tokens that you have held

754
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:00,990
or hold currently-- are
any of them functional?

755
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:03,530
Like, they can be
used on a network?

756
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:04,200
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

757
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,405
And I actually use
at least one of them.

758
00:36:07,405 --> 00:36:08,830
GARY GENSLER: All right.

759
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:10,758
Here.

760
00:36:10,758 --> 00:36:12,550
Are you an owner, or
you've got a question?

761
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,020
AUDIENCE: I'm an
owner, but not--

762
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,510
I haven't voted.

763
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:17,410
Both the tokens-- I'm
mining the tokens.

764
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:22,430
But in any case, I
wouldn't disregard maybe

765
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:27,860
tokens that's a valid way of
generating a means to jumpstart

766
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:34,840
a network and create
some sort of valid way

767
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:41,270
to drive collective action for
some disintermediation effort,

768
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:43,230
because I mean I--

769
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:45,820
and I think it's a
little bit unfair

770
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:50,920
to ask if we kind of
join or support ICOs

771
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,397
in the context of there's
huge amount of scams

772
00:36:54,397 --> 00:36:56,230
that are [INAUDIBLE]
right now in the media.

773
00:36:56,230 --> 00:37:00,037
But I wouldn't disregard the
whole concept of tokens here.

774
00:37:00,037 --> 00:37:01,120
GARY GENSLER: [INAUDIBLE].

775
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,370
I admit it might have
been an unfair question.

776
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:04,720
I was just trying to get--

777
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:09,740
I was just trying to get some
support in the room for tokens.

778
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:12,550
AUDIENCE: The concept for
me is absolutely valid.

779
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:15,310
I would explore,
seriously explore--

780
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:18,850
if I launch a startup
in the blockchain space,

781
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:20,890
seriously explore
the possibility

782
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:25,030
of using maybe tokens in the
permissionless environment.

783
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,500
So I suppose the permission--

784
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:31,720
GARY GENSLER: So I think
that there is definitely

785
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:37,830
a future in this overall
technology of making

786
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:42,820
a database harder
to tamper with,

787
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:45,460
more immutable on
a scale, maybe not

788
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:48,830
100% immutable, but
closer to that immutable

789
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:51,580
and inverifiable.

790
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:56,060
I think that native tokens
could help jump start a network.

791
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:59,740
What I think the challenge
is I think the challenge is,

792
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:02,490
how do you compete
with fiat currency

793
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:07,110
that has such extraordinary
network effects?

794
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:10,790
So the Ernst & Young study,
the recent study, I think

795
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:14,870
captures this a bit when they
looked at the 140 largest ICOs

796
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:17,030
from 2017.

797
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:20,390
Only about I think
it was 17 of 140

798
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:22,850
have a functioning
network right now,

799
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:26,330
where you can use
the token, 13%.

800
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:30,110
But of those 17, I
think seven of them,

801
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:32,360
the networks that are
live, instead of, well,

802
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,720
guess what, we'll also take
fiat currency for this service

803
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,850
that we're providing,
whether they're providing

804
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:39,600
file storage or something else.

805
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,570
So they definitely
used a native token

806
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:45,050
to jumpstart the network
as a crowdfunding,

807
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:49,550
but then when they got to
the later functional stage,

808
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,710
the operator, the
entrepreneur says,

809
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,740
I don't want to limit my users.

810
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:57,260
I'm going to also take fiat
currency to buy or secure

811
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:59,720
whatever service I'm having.

812
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:02,840
And I think that's the
business model challenge.

813
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:10,110
And it may well be that
there are networks,

814
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:13,890
just like in gaming sites,
where you want skins or shields,

815
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:17,430
and there's something about
only trading those tokens.

816
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:23,250
But to date, that's
been a limited class.

817
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:28,680
That's where I probably
will declare myself.

818
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,860
I think, of course, there's
a bunch of tradeoffs

819
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:34,110
over the next three
to seven years

820
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:38,350
that will be sorted out around
performance, privacy, security.

821
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,970
We talked about layer 2.

822
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:43,230
If any of you are actually
interested in work

823
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:45,090
in the blockchain
technology field,

824
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:47,670
you're going to learn a
lot about layer 2 solutions

825
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:51,630
and side chains and all the
performance scalability things

826
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:54,420
that colleagues over at the
Digital Currency Initiative

827
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:59,010
are spending a lot of time
on this question right here.

828
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:01,620
And then, of course,
this is a business model.

829
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,502
Just purely as a
venture capitalist,

830
00:40:03,502 --> 00:40:05,460
you have to think about,
how do I get adoption?

831
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,770
How do-- what's my
customer user interface?

832
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:10,920
I'm sure, Iman, you're thinking
a lot about this, right?

833
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,860
You could have the best
idea on a data structure.

834
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:17,460
You could have a really
nifty idea on a native token.

835
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,590
But you still have
to deal with whatever

836
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:24,270
venture capitalist has to do is,
how do I get users to use this?

837
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:24,900
Adoption.

838
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,120
What's my UI?

839
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:32,310
And it's sort of a much
more generic set of issues.

840
00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:32,810
Iman.

841
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:34,980
AUDIENCE: That was
my answer to Jihee.

842
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,900
She's totally right.

843
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:43,380
It's all about-- it's a tension
between adoption and quality

844
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,640
of product.

845
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,188
And that's why we
moved from Ethereum

846
00:40:48,188 --> 00:40:49,230
to the public blockchain.

847
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:53,710
But we didn't think that
it will be mass adopt by--

848
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:56,550
massively adopted
by the incumbents.

849
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:59,580
So we moved to a
permission blockchain

850
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,585
because of the adoption.

851
00:41:01,585 --> 00:41:03,960
GARY GENSLER: And I can't
remember if you're able to say.

852
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,430
Which are you using--

853
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:08,040
Hyperledger Fabric or Corda or?

854
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,750
AUDIENCE: We're using Corda
because of the state channels

855
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:14,110
solution that they provide.

856
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:17,260
GARY GENSLER: So we
talked about frameworks.

857
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:21,430
Over time, it's my thought that
that orange line, the slope

858
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:23,560
of that will come down,
and we'll move more

859
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,900
towards the decentralized side.

860
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:30,100
But for the orange line, the
slope to come down, in essence,

861
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:34,540
the costs of the scalability,
security, even the coordination

862
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,740
needs to come down.

863
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:38,920
It's always going to be some
challenge on governance.

864
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,490
In essence, who is going
to pay for the software

865
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:47,170
development in a truly
decentralized network?

866
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:52,900
And Bitcoin has been supported,
for instance, by, really,

867
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:56,200
an incredible group of
Bitcoin Core developers,

868
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,390
in part because
they just believe

869
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,520
in it, in part that
some are funded

870
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:04,530
by institutions like MIT.

871
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:07,720
But it's still-- it's always
a challenge in a truly

872
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:09,310
decentralized space.

873
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:10,570
Who's going to fund--

874
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:14,680
who's got the economic interest
to fund the continued updates

875
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,850
and software?

876
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:21,280
I think Uber could be completely
a decentralized network.

877
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:25,210
And probably, drivers
would get paid more.

878
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,490
But then where would
be the incentive?

879
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:29,710
Who would work on the
software development

880
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:33,420
to update their ride app?

881
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:37,310
So there's a key tradeoff there.

882
00:42:37,310 --> 00:42:40,340
The financial sector--
well, it moves and allocates

883
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,510
money and risk.

884
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:42,890
We talked about that.

885
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:45,170
But it relies on a
system of ledgers,

886
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:50,390
and it's always had a symbiotic
relationship with technology.

887
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:53,450
The opportunities-- these
are the key opportunities,

888
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:55,460
which I think any
thought fintech--

889
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:59,060
it's not just blockchain but
even AI and machine learning--

890
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,370
has around finances.

891
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,900
The customer
interfaces-- there's

892
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,850
a lot of legacy
customer interfaces

893
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:06,410
that you can actually
compete with,

894
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:08,150
if you're doing a startup.

895
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:10,750
The economic rents are high.

896
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:13,730
There's 7 and 1/2 percent
of the economy is finance.

897
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:16,340
Not all of the 7 and
1/2 percent is rents,

898
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:19,470
but there is a lot of extra--

899
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:22,220
excuse the expression-- a
lot of extra vig or juice

900
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:26,330
in that model.

901
00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:29,300
And, of course, we've
had repeated crises

902
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,260
and instability.

903
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:33,800
And financial inclusion--
we talked about products

904
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,980
like Alipay and M-Pesa
that were really

905
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:41,430
about financial inclusion
using new technologies.

906
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:43,940
So what are the
technologies in our time?

907
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:47,840
I just put up a nice
little graphic here.

908
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,790
I'm doing some work
with a group called

909
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:53,810
FinTech at CSAIL, the Computer
Science and AI Lab here.

910
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:56,180
And when we leave with
the funding companies,

911
00:43:56,180 --> 00:44:00,780
the big funding companies
of that unit over there,

912
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:03,635
blockchain is on their list,
but it's not number one.

913
00:44:03,635 --> 00:44:06,625
To just put it in context, in
terms of their technologies,

914
00:44:06,625 --> 00:44:08,250
they're thinking
about machine learning

915
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:12,270
and AI would probably
be the biggest piece.

916
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:15,300
But just to give a flavor for--

917
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:18,990
but it's one of the
top three or four.

918
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:22,050
But as we've talked about,
they have challenges.

919
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:25,040
The financial sector
sees a lot of challenges.

920
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,540
AUDIENCE: I just want to
go back to previous slides,

921
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:30,930
and how would the virtual
reality impact finance?

922
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:32,660
I'm not sure.

923
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:33,160
[INAUDIBLE]

924
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:34,535
GARY GENSLER: That
has happened--

925
00:44:34,535 --> 00:44:36,650
AUDIENCE: AR and VR,
[INAUDIBLE] tech, finance.

926
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:43,150
GARY GENSLER: I'm not
familiar with the projects

927
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:44,890
in that space.

928
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:48,403
But where-- and I'm
sure I'm getting now,

929
00:44:48,403 --> 00:44:50,320
you're going to inspire
me to do some research

930
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:53,770
in the next day or two to shoot
your email with some projects.

931
00:44:53,770 --> 00:45:01,090
But virtual reality
and hearing it does

932
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:03,340
allow for more
financial inclusion.

933
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:07,750
And the question really
is, can you just, rather--

934
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:09,460
think of the user experience.

935
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:17,530
If you can find an enjoyable
way to spend more money

936
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:20,530
through virtual reality,
the banking system

937
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:22,900
wants to tap into that.

938
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:27,010
It's not one of the top
things at FinTech at CSAIL,

939
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:31,060
I'd say AI, machine learning,
biometrics, and blockchain.

940
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:32,800
Everything's in the
cloud, so they're not

941
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:37,030
asking, right now, MIT to
help them with cloud issues.

942
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:40,120
Open API is a really big
issue, particularly in London

943
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:43,900
and in the UK, where it's been
regulated that the banks need

944
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:45,910
to use Open API.

945
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:49,090
So I'd say AR and
virtual reality

946
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:53,110
is probably eighth
on the list there.

947
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:56,050
And I just include it,
because I kind of think it's--

948
00:45:56,050 --> 00:46:00,190
they'll find a way to
change a user interface.

949
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:02,950
We talked about there's
a bunch of issues,

950
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:05,830
and that's really
leading to the use.

951
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:08,560
We talked about traditional
databases, which--

952
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:12,220
where parties can just
create, read, write,

953
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:14,650
the ledger, the private
blockchain, which,

954
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:21,220
of course, is what most of
trade finance, most of payments,

955
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:23,470
all the big central banks
that have looked at it

956
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:27,300
or moved from Ethereum to
doing Hyperledger projects--

957
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:30,490
Singapore and Canada's Jasper--

958
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:32,650
and maybe permissionless.

959
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:39,300
But the finance is really in
the second bucket right now.

960
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:42,480
Eric, it's not to say that
native tokens won't take off

961
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,300
and, Hugo, that your portfolio
will be worth something, maybe.

962
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:54,550
So here, we went through
a bunch of use cases.

963
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:57,750
But the biggest use case so far
has been the $20 to $30 billion

964
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:01,830
that's been raised through ICOs.

965
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:06,950
I personally think that's
going to come down, way down.

966
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:09,410
But payment systems--

967
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:14,700
I mean we might differ on
the views of XRP, a token,

968
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,680
but Ripple and
other companies have

969
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:20,220
done a lot to try to be a
catalyst for change and payment

970
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:21,250
systems.

971
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:22,950
We talked a lot
about trade finance.

972
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:24,720
Again, they're more
in the permissions

973
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:25,980
than the permissionless.

974
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:31,990
Clearing and settling--
what's going on in Australia.

975
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:35,970
Again, permissionless, not--
I mean permissioned, not

976
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:38,910
permissionless.

977
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:43,240
And then some of
the non-financial--

978
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:46,290
had a lively discussion about
supply chain management,

979
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:51,160
and James, I'll forever remember
that you're not a fan of it.

980
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:55,330
But Walmart and Cargo
might disagree with James.

981
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:58,480
And they have active
projects on it.

982
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,160
And Lauren gave--
where's Lauren?

983
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,790
She's here, maybe--
gave a reason why

984
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:06,490
in supply chain
sustainability that you

985
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:08,080
might be on the other side.

986
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:14,180
Digital ID was the last
thing we talked about.

987
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:17,890
So there's a lot going on, and
when there's $20 or $30 billion

988
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:19,930
raised, there's going
to be-- these projects

989
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:21,620
will have some life to them.

990
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:26,410
We'll learn a lot from
them along the way.

991
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:28,720
Crypto finance-- when I
first put this slide up,

992
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,350
it wasn't $110 billion.

993
00:48:30,350 --> 00:48:32,590
And gosh knows I
did this yesterday,

994
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:35,350
so I don't even know
what it is today.

995
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:36,790
Pretty volatile market.

996
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:41,480
Interestingly, Bitcoin staggered
about 55% or 57% of the market.

997
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:48,450
So there's a high correlation,
though Ethereum slid, and XRP

998
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:54,510
is number two in that market
since we first got together

999
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:56,640
in September.

1000
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:01,290
Here, what I think the
challenge is, as an investor--

1001
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:03,840
I'm not trying to pick on
you, Hugo, but you know,

1002
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,160
an investor.

1003
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,770
But I think that's the
number one challenge.

1004
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:09,500
I really do.

1005
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,430
What's the viability
of that token?

1006
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:12,680
And Eric, I'll agree with you.

1007
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:15,120
Some tokens will
be worth something.

1008
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:16,700
But it's assessing that.

1009
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:19,940
But the markets are readily
susceptible to fraud.

1010
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:22,160
How do I keep custody
for the private key?

1011
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,880
Fidelity has announced
they're going

1012
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,000
to have a new
private key solution,

1013
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,940
so it's interesting that big
incumbents are coming in.

1014
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:34,490
It's not just the Zappos and the
early stage custody solutions.

1015
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:38,330
Even Backed, the
Intercontinental Exchange,

1016
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:39,830
has put a lot of money into it.

1017
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:42,380
And they'll, in essence,
have a custody solution,

1018
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:45,590
because you could buy
Bitcoin, one day futures,

1019
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:47,960
have a Bitcoin, and then
they would, in essence,

1020
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,210
hold custody for you.

1021
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:54,950
And then we talked
about crypto exchanges.

1022
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:57,760
And the key thing-- and
if you take anything away

1023
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,460
about exchanges, other than
right now they're unregulated

1024
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:03,520
and they're probably highly
susceptible to front running

1025
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:06,880
and manipulation, is that
they're a little bit different,

1026
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,130
because they're
not just matching

1027
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:12,370
agents, which the London Stock
Exchange or the New York Stock

1028
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:15,430
Exchange are [INAUDIBLE],, but
they also are counterparties

1029
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:16,510
and custodians.

1030
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:22,750
The other thing to take
away about crypto exchanges

1031
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:24,430
is they're highly centralized.

1032
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:28,330
So it's a central irony that
Satoshi Nakamoto is trying

1033
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:32,190
to have decentralization,
and yet there's

1034
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:35,090
an awful lot of centralization.

1035
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:37,580
So I'm just thinking
about core takeaways.

1036
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:39,980
If you're ever investing, or
you're thinking about this,

1037
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:42,560
or you're just involved in
a dinner party conversation,

1038
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:45,620
that central irony in
a decentralized space,

1039
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:51,530
95% of the real transactions are
happening on crypto exchanges.

1040
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:56,130
My thought about
crypto exchanges--

1041
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:59,990
they'll not be 200 of them
that much longer either.

1042
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:02,060
We talked about
Initial Coin Offerings.

1043
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:05,670
Central takeaway is they're
fundraising vehicles.

1044
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:07,430
Whether you believe
in or not believe

1045
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:11,420
in the US and Canadian
approach under the Howey Test,

1046
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:16,760
but they help build a network,
raise money in anticipation

1047
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:19,985
the tokens are issued
before it's functional.

1048
00:51:19,985 --> 00:51:24,110
I think the latest
study was that--

1049
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:26,570
what was it-- 1 and 1/2 percent
are actually functional,

1050
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:29,210
and 98 and 1/2 percent
are issued pre-functional.

1051
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:31,550
So that's not a problem.

1052
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:34,610
It's just-- that's the--

1053
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:36,830
means it's probably an
investment vehicle, not

1054
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:38,270
a utility token.

1055
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:40,260
And that whole thing
about utility token

1056
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:46,010
versus security tokens, it
stretched pretty darn thin.

1057
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:48,680
We talked about public
policy frameworks,

1058
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:51,200
guarding against illicit
activity, financial stability,

1059
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,610
investing public.

1060
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:56,090
My overall thought on this--

1061
00:51:56,090 --> 00:51:59,210
and I accept that others
will have other views--

1062
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:05,240
is that any new technology, if
it grows to be economy-wide,

1063
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:08,630
needs to live within
public policy frameworks,

1064
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:12,560
or society will change those
public policy frameworks

1065
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,190
modestly.

1066
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:16,070
But you still want
to protect the public

1067
00:52:16,070 --> 00:52:18,790
against core social goods.

1068
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:20,590
It happened when the
railroad came along.

1069
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:23,230
It happened when telegram came
along in the 19th century.

1070
00:52:23,230 --> 00:52:25,610
It happened with the internet.

1071
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:27,770
Societies don't
have technologies

1072
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:33,870
fully outside of whatever
social fabric we want to create.

1073
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:35,850
And we do that
social fabric stuff

1074
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:40,770
through politics and parliaments
and executives and regulators.

1075
00:52:40,770 --> 00:52:45,490
But we don't leave big parts
of our economy outside of it.

1076
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:47,545
This stuff is still small.

1077
00:52:47,545 --> 00:52:49,240
It's $100 billion.

1078
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:54,240
The worldwide capital markets
are over $300 trillion.

1079
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:57,930
But it's gained a lot
of public attention.

1080
00:52:57,930 --> 00:53:01,740
And particularly, we want to
guard against illicit activity.

1081
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:04,650
Most folks do.

1082
00:53:04,650 --> 00:53:05,790
Maybe not everybody.

1083
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:07,310
But most do.

1084
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:08,850
No, I recognize.

1085
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:09,990
Hopefully, you all do.

1086
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:10,800
Well, I don't know.

1087
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:16,790
So we talked about the US
Securities Law, the Howey Test.

1088
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:21,090
It's not-- if you forget the
Howey Test, it's totally fine.

1089
00:53:21,090 --> 00:53:24,570
But it's core to these
initial coin offerings,

1090
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:26,490
and it was that four-part test--

1091
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:28,500
investment of money in
a common enterprise,

1092
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:31,030
expectation of profits.

1093
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:32,760
So if you get into
some debate, and you

1094
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,330
want to have some
fun with somebody,

1095
00:53:34,330 --> 00:53:35,850
you can say you
know the Howey Test.

1096
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:40,390
But it's really more this.

1097
00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:42,450
I prefer the Duck Test.

1098
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:44,280
Just use common sense.

1099
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:47,460
This course has been more
about critical reasoning skills

1100
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:48,690
than anything.

1101
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:51,450
So if somebody's trying to sell
you something or hustle you

1102
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:54,300
on something, and you are
now a venture capitalist,

1103
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:57,870
and you're investing,
use the Duck Test.

1104
00:53:57,870 --> 00:53:59,430
You can even remember
the Duck Test

1105
00:53:59,430 --> 00:54:01,770
about whether they're trying
to sell you something,

1106
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:04,090
and it has nothing
to do with the law.

1107
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:11,010
It just-- so where do I think
crypto exchanges will go?

1108
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:15,390
I think that they'll have to
fix this whole custodial duty

1109
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:16,110
stuff.

1110
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:19,750
They might all use
Fidelity's product.

1111
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:24,780
Or they'll keep it
in-house or spin it off.

1112
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:27,790
I think they'll have to start
complying with any money

1113
00:54:27,790 --> 00:54:28,290
laundering.

1114
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:31,890
We saw one study that said
a quarter of all exchanges

1115
00:54:31,890 --> 00:54:34,530
don't even have any AML.

1116
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:38,970
I think two years from
now, that will be way down.

1117
00:54:38,970 --> 00:54:42,150
I think margins
will compress, and I

1118
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:43,980
don't think there'll
be 200 exchanges

1119
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,840
two or three years from now.

1120
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,570
There'll be five or
10 relevant exchanges

1121
00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:51,360
at some point in time.

1122
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,942
On Initial Coin
Offerings, I think

1123
00:54:52,942 --> 00:54:54,900
we're going to keep seeing
a high failure rate.

1124
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:57,150
There's still about 200 a
month, but there'll probably

1125
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:59,730
be fewer of them.

1126
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:03,180
I think that there's going to
be a lot of enforcement actions.

1127
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:04,860
Occasionally, you'll
see something--

1128
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:07,430
the Securities and Exchange
Commission or some other--

1129
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:09,240
maybe it will be in
Japan or elsewhere will

1130
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,310
be bringing more cases.

1131
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:14,670
And what will be interesting
in 2019 is to watch,

1132
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:17,580
does any of the
big ones go live?

1133
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:19,740
And I think this
will be a real test.

1134
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:21,990
Does Filecoin figure
out what to do?

1135
00:55:21,990 --> 00:55:24,690
They raised a quarter
of a billion dollars.

1136
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:29,420
Telegram raised $1.7 billion.

1137
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:31,430
Do they figure out
what to do and make

1138
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:34,040
a real live effort in 2019?

1139
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,140
And it will test the economics.

1140
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:38,060
And by the way, Eric,
it might pull me more

1141
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:40,640
towards where you are, right?

1142
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:43,610
I mean Telegram's-- they got a
lot of smart folks over there

1143
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:45,320
working on this.

1144
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:47,820
And by the way, Facebook
has advertisements out

1145
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:50,380
hiring people on
blockchain technology.

1146
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:53,280
So there's a lot of very
big tech companies hiring

1147
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,060
and recruiting in this space.

1148
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:57,930
But I think 2019 will be
interesting to see, what does--

1149
00:55:57,930 --> 00:55:58,680
what is Telegram?

1150
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:59,580
What is Filecoin?

1151
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:03,000
What do some of the big,
hopefully, well-meaning

1152
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,990
companies do with these tokens?

1153
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:10,650
Central banks-- mostly
in the monitor phase.

1154
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:12,948
But I'd say the thing
to watch is Sweden.

1155
00:56:12,948 --> 00:56:14,490
It'll be really
interesting what they

1156
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:16,370
do with their E-krona project.

1157
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:20,610
Do they go live and say,
inspired by blockchain?

1158
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:23,490
The E-krona project is
not blockchain technology,

1159
00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:27,930
but it's completely inspired by
Satoshi Nakamoto saying, well,

1160
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:33,000
we, the central bank, Jihee's
the central bank says,

1161
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,240
we're going to do what
Satoshi Nakamoto's--

1162
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:39,630
we're going to have a
central bank digital token.

1163
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:41,140
You can use it at Starbucks.

1164
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:42,630
You can use it wherever.

1165
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:43,410
I'd watch that.

1166
00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:47,690
I think Venezuela will
probably fail on the other end.

1167
00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:48,780
But it'll be interesting.

1168
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:54,720
There might be some distressed
country that does something.

1169
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:57,310
So how would I conclude?

1170
00:56:57,310 --> 00:56:58,680
I think blockchain does--

1171
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:01,110
this is my disclosure.

1172
00:57:01,110 --> 00:57:04,560
I think it does provide a
real peer-to-peer alternative.

1173
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:08,640
I think it's a legit
live application.

1174
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:11,860
It might not be the best, but
is it better than some others?

1175
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:14,550
Is it something you could use?

1176
00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:16,676
Verification and
networking cost--

1177
00:57:16,676 --> 00:57:19,110
I'm going to repeat on that--

1178
00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:21,330
is the key.

1179
00:57:21,330 --> 00:57:23,520
But you always, I think,
have to assess, is it

1180
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:24,930
the right use case?

1181
00:57:24,930 --> 00:57:28,013
Is this use case
the right use case?

1182
00:57:28,013 --> 00:57:29,430
But as we've talked,
I think there

1183
00:57:29,430 --> 00:57:32,940
are real use cases
more in permissioned

1184
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:34,510
than permissionless.

1185
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:38,110
Remember anything.

1186
00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:42,790
Money is just-- we all
humans, the 7 billion

1187
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:45,730
of us that live now,
have to thank somebody

1188
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:50,020
about 10,000 years ago, but came
up with this technology called

1189
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:51,370
money.

1190
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:53,560
Store value, medium
of exchange, unit

1191
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,870
of account-- it's just a
social construct, which

1192
00:57:55,870 --> 00:57:58,480
is a reason why I say, we
could have a social construct

1193
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,380
that is decentralized money.

1194
00:58:01,380 --> 00:58:04,330
I absolutely believe
we could have that.

1195
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:06,130
But we'd all have to accept it.

1196
00:58:06,130 --> 00:58:09,160
Where I have less
optimism is that you'd

1197
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:13,360
want to accept it for a
closed, bounded ecosystem

1198
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:15,340
only for file storage.

1199
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:18,430
That's where I'm a
little challenged as to,

1200
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:23,930
what is the real
economics of that?

1201
00:58:23,930 --> 00:58:25,820
Financial sector's
characteristics

1202
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:27,560
and challenges--

1203
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:29,080
is it good?

1204
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:33,530
It's fertile ground, because
finance is built on ledgers.

1205
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:35,090
And finance is big--

1206
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:38,440
7 and 1/2 percent
of our economy.

1207
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:41,210
And around the globe,
it's anywhere from 5%

1208
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:43,420
to probably 8% of
those economies.

1209
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:45,510
Most other countries,
it's less than the US,

1210
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:49,190
but it's still-- it's big.

1211
00:58:49,190 --> 00:58:50,690
Incumbents are,
of course, looking

1212
00:58:50,690 --> 00:58:52,970
at permissioned blockchains.

1213
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:54,740
And unfortunately,
crypto finance

1214
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:57,800
has a bunch of scams and frauds.

1215
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:01,860
And that hurts the development.

1216
00:59:01,860 --> 00:59:05,730
But I think adoption
will come, but it

1217
00:59:05,730 --> 00:59:08,070
rests on solving a bunch
of technical issues,

1218
00:59:08,070 --> 00:59:11,800
like the Digital Currency
Initiative's trying to solve.

1219
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:14,560
What are the commercial use
cases and the public policy?

1220
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:16,110
I wouldn't lead
with public policy.

1221
00:59:16,110 --> 00:59:18,380
I don't think that's
the main issue here.

1222
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:21,200
But if this is ever
going to be anything,

1223
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:24,400
it's got to get over that.

1224
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,920
So mostly, it's probably going
to be a catalyst for change,

1225
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:31,710
more than actual real thoughts.

1226
00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:32,722
Questions?

1227
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:37,620
Thoughts?

1228
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:38,185
Eric.

1229
00:59:38,185 --> 00:59:41,653
AUDIENCE: On the
third point, I--

1230
00:59:41,653 --> 00:59:43,320
GARY GENSLER: Use
cases must address why

1231
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,060
versus a traditional database.

1232
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:46,530
AUDIENCE: I always
had the feeling

1233
00:59:46,530 --> 00:59:49,470
that it seemed the
permissioned space, where

1234
00:59:49,470 --> 00:59:54,190
you have the most or the
biggest urge to prove where--

1235
00:59:54,190 --> 01:00:00,630
if your submission needs a
blockchain solution as opposed

1236
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:01,925
to a traditional--

1237
01:00:01,925 --> 01:00:05,040
I mean making a case against
the centralized database

1238
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:08,755
is kind of easy, versus
a distributed database.

1239
01:00:08,755 --> 01:00:11,210
I think it's a little bit tough.

1240
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:13,987
But in the
permissionless space, I

1241
01:00:13,987 --> 01:00:15,570
think you don't have
to struggle much,

1242
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:18,810
because it's absolutely
justified that you can--

1243
01:00:18,810 --> 01:00:23,010
because you're dealing with a
decentralized configuration,

1244
01:00:23,010 --> 01:00:27,900
where there's no one in
charge of guaranteeing

1245
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:30,020
that we have a--

1246
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:32,310
GARY GENSLER: So Eric's
raising the question,

1247
01:00:32,310 --> 01:00:34,480
why not use a
traditional database?

1248
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,120
Why ever use a permissioned--

1249
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:37,620
AUDIENCE: In the
permissioned space,

1250
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:40,080
because permissionless
is perfectly justified.

1251
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,550
But in the
permissioned space, I'm

1252
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:44,500
not saying it's not justified.

1253
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:48,840
The point is being
that in our project,

1254
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:51,810
we argued for a
permissioned system.

1255
01:00:51,810 --> 01:00:53,910
We made some justifications
in that space,

1256
01:00:53,910 --> 01:00:59,970
so the point is that I just
wanted to get your thoughts so

1257
01:00:59,970 --> 01:01:01,760
that in the
permissionless spaces,

1258
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:04,140
you don't have to
struggle much in that.

1259
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:08,800
GARY GENSLER: Permissionless
blockchain technology,

1260
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,480
looking forward a
number of years,

1261
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:13,570
looking forward to when some of
the scalability and performance

1262
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:17,540
gets better, can give
you verification costs.

1263
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:22,720
And it's censorship-resistant
or practically

1264
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:27,010
censorship-resistant, unless
somebody does a 51% attack.

1265
01:01:27,010 --> 01:01:31,120
But so I think that the truly
decentralized distributed

1266
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:36,480
permissionless system has
a lot of-- a lot to offer.

1267
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:39,710
But it comes with a lot of
costs, too, and challenges--

1268
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:44,240
hard to do the governance and
hard to get coordinated action.

1269
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:46,700
And as you've heard
me say, I think

1270
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:49,400
there's only probably going
to be a very limited use

1271
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:56,400
cases for native tokens,
native product-specific tokens

1272
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:03,690
like a Filecoin or a restaurant
review coin or a health care

1273
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:04,740
coin.

1274
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:08,070
I have-- I have my
doubts about that.

1275
01:02:08,070 --> 01:02:11,820
An economy-wide coin, a
cryptocurrency like Bitcoin--

1276
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:14,190
I think there's more
use, particularly

1277
01:02:14,190 --> 01:02:17,520
if you have a weak central
bank, a weak fiscal policy.

1278
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:22,620
A country like Venezuela in the
future might adopt something.

1279
01:02:22,620 --> 01:02:24,840
I think there's a lot to
be said for permissionless,

1280
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:28,590
but permissioned systems versus
traditional databases, I think,

1281
01:02:28,590 --> 01:02:30,180
also gives something.

1282
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:33,150
And I'll use the Australian
stock exchange for one,

1283
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:34,950
but they know their customers.

1284
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:35,910
They know they have--

1285
01:02:35,910 --> 01:02:38,640
I think the number
was 77 members.

1286
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:42,510
They can take their database
and decentralize it and put it

1287
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:47,730
on all 77 member companies,
if that's the right number,

1288
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:51,180
and say, you're
now sharing that.

1289
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:53,610
And so then there's no
single point of failure,

1290
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:56,370
and we can lower what's
called reconciliation costs,

1291
01:02:56,370 --> 01:02:59,370
because you all needed
some of that data anyway.

1292
01:02:59,370 --> 01:03:04,620
The historic data-keeping,
the historic nature of it

1293
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:07,230
came up with each
of those 77 members

1294
01:03:07,230 --> 01:03:09,370
having individual databases.

1295
01:03:09,370 --> 01:03:12,540
So I could see that there is
a real benefit in probably

1296
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:15,810
efficiency and
lowering costs, which

1297
01:03:15,810 --> 01:03:18,650
means lowering costs
of verification,

1298
01:03:18,650 --> 01:03:20,400
lowering networking
costs, because there's

1299
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,250
77 members, trade finance.

1300
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:25,030
I could see some
of that as well.

1301
01:03:25,030 --> 01:03:27,240
So that-- but you
might be right.

1302
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,920
Oracle might be
able to just adopt

1303
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:30,290
that in a traditional database.

1304
01:03:30,290 --> 01:03:30,865
Sabrina.

1305
01:03:30,865 --> 01:03:32,490
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so
it seems like you're

1306
01:03:32,490 --> 01:03:35,800
describing that they have some
form of distributed consensus.

1307
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,390
And that's the
main reason, right?

1308
01:03:37,390 --> 01:03:38,836
But there's--

1309
01:03:38,836 --> 01:03:40,890
GARY GENSLER: And
distributed the data

1310
01:03:40,890 --> 01:03:43,980
stored on multiple nodes,
because it's multiple copies

1311
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:45,040
of the same data.

1312
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:47,580
AUDIENCE: Right, but yeah.

1313
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:50,690
There's-- I mean if that still
can be implemented without

1314
01:03:50,690 --> 01:03:51,770
watching.

1315
01:03:51,770 --> 01:03:54,456
I'm playing the Aleem
today, since he's not here.

1316
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:55,517
But there's no--

1317
01:03:55,517 --> 01:03:56,600
GARY GENSLER: No, but we--

1318
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:59,670
AUDIENCE: That's been a long
solved problem of how consensus

1319
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:01,360
algorithms that--
or you can replicate

1320
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:06,380
state on the same state
on both the machines

1321
01:04:06,380 --> 01:04:09,490
and tolerate some [INAUDIBLE]
number of failures.

1322
01:04:09,490 --> 01:04:14,470
So I personally don't really
see the use of blockchain

1323
01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:18,990
in permissioned systems, but
I do see a lot of potential

1324
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:21,780
for permissionless systems,
just because those algorithms

1325
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:24,540
already exist out there
to do [INAUDIBLE]..

1326
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:26,550
GARY GENSLER: So what
Sabrina's raising--

1327
01:04:26,550 --> 01:04:28,410
you can take the Sabrina seat.

1328
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:34,060
You're-- Sabrina's a master's
student at computer science

1329
01:04:34,060 --> 01:04:38,160
at MIT, so she probably knows
what she's talking about--

1330
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:41,910
is really saying, well,
you can do a lot of that.

1331
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:44,640
You can have
distributed databases

1332
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:47,250
without blockchain technology.

1333
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:49,380
You can have-- and
there's ways that

1334
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:52,380
this Byzantine-fought
tolerance has been addressed

1335
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:55,860
in distributed
databases that you don't

1336
01:04:55,860 --> 01:04:57,510
need blockchain technology.

1337
01:04:57,510 --> 01:05:02,055
The concept of a block,
commitment hash, block,

1338
01:05:02,055 --> 01:05:06,100
a commitment hash,
block technology.

1339
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:07,240
And I accept that.

1340
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:10,890
But I'm not going
to accept it to say

1341
01:05:10,890 --> 01:05:13,830
that there's no space for
permissioned blockchain

1342
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:15,510
technology.

1343
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:17,880
What there is space
for is the 80 of you

1344
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:21,760
in this room to have different
opinions on all of this.

1345
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:22,765
You want to close out?

1346
01:05:22,765 --> 01:05:24,640
I want to-- I have one
more slide I want to--

1347
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:26,628
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1348
01:05:26,628 --> 01:05:28,670
GARY GENSLER: So this is,
of course, about money,

1349
01:05:28,670 --> 01:05:31,760
so I went back and found a
quote from Benjamin Franklin

1350
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:32,750
that I like.

1351
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:36,320
And to me, it's about a concept
that I hope you all live by.

1352
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:38,920
It's paying it forward.

1353
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:43,520
Paying forward is partly
because all of us in this room

1354
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:44,360
are privileged.

1355
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:51,170
We're at MIT or Harvard or
Wellesley, but we're at MIT.

1356
01:05:51,170 --> 01:05:52,970
And so what did
Ben Franklin say?

1357
01:05:52,970 --> 01:05:55,430
And it does close on money.

1358
01:05:55,430 --> 01:05:57,260
"I do not pretend
to give such a deed.

1359
01:05:57,260 --> 01:05:59,750
I only lend it to you.

1360
01:05:59,750 --> 01:06:02,540
When you meet another honest
man in similar distress,

1361
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:06,980
you must pay me by
lending this sum to him

1362
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:11,390
and joining him to discharge
the debt by a like operation,"

1363
01:06:11,390 --> 01:06:14,770
