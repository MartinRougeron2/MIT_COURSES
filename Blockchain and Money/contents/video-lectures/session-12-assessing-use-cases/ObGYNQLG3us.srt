00:00:21,742 --> 00:00:23,700
GARY GENSLER: So we're
going to come back again

9
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,710
today to blockchain economics.

10
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,250
A lot of what we're going to
talk about today while again

11
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,240
anchored in the
readings will also

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:38,220
be relevant as we
now turn to after Sip

13
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,640
week to act three where
we're going through use cases

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,130
but also hopefully relevant as
you're starting to think, OK,

15
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,130
what about this final
project and so forth

16
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:51,350
and what do we need to do?

17
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,570
Five or six of the groups
have come in either

18
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,050
as an individual person or teams
of three or four have come in

19
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,330
and bounced ideas off of me.

20
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:03,186
So I want to thank all of
the groups that have come in,

21
00:01:03,186 --> 00:01:04,769
because you've helped
me also organize

22
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,070
some of my talking
points for today

23
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,330
as to what we're going through.

24
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,900
And those of you
who haven't come in,

25
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,520
feel free to set things
up if you find it helpful.

26
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,390
It's not mandatory.

27
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:20,370
But you can also
thank the six groups

28
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,290
that have come in,
because now I'm

29
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:28,410
trying to anticipate
your questions as well

30
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,850
along the way.

31
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:35,970
So, the overview of course our
reading and study questions

32
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,770
will come through.

33
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,290
There was the letter
to Jamie Dimon.

34
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,000
So we're going to dive
into that one a little bit.

35
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,340
I found it interesting when
I read it about a year ago.

36
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,370
And then I thought, why not
throw it into to the mix here?

37
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:55,200
The McKinsey report,
which, again, I

38
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,920
found this to be true for years.

39
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,620
It's not just this
class that you

40
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,830
can find some consultant that's
put a generalized paper out,

41
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,652
it does sort of
just skim the tops,

42
00:02:04,652 --> 00:02:06,360
but you're getting a
sense of how they're

43
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,970
trying to gin up business.

44
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,962
Their business model is to
write some of these reports.

45
00:02:11,962 --> 00:02:13,920
And some of you are going
to go into consulting

46
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,990
and maybe even write these
reports at some point in time.

47
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,470
But it's often a good way
to see what I'll call it

48
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,890
just a survey, a
topical survey in how

49
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:24,600
folks think about things.

50
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,760
Quickly a little bit
on potential use cases.

51
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,970
In the heart of
today's discussion

52
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,710
and kind of the
heart for thinking

53
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:35,940
about the final projects
is how to really assess

54
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,660
the costs and benefits of
any potential use case.

55
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:44,100
So I'll skip through
the study questions.

56
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,830
But these are the key.

57
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,200
I didn't see anybody go
in the discussion board.

58
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,890
I looked.

59
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,690
Did you see anything there?

60
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:52,560
No.

61
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,430
we did set it up.

62
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,740
But what are the
potential benefits,

63
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:02,910
and how do you assess
the cost of trusts?

64
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:07,950
And that is going to be true
in every single project you

65
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:08,460
look at.

66
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:11,300
If you take anything
from this class,

67
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,240
it's this core critical
reasoning of like--

68
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,490
and hopefully after
the Roubini paper

69
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:21,540
last Tuesday, we're going
to come out of the doldrums

70
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,880
and we're going to pull back
out of the minimalist side

71
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,842
and get more in the middle.

72
00:03:25,842 --> 00:03:28,050
I might not get Alin lean
out of the minimalist side,

73
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:28,750
I don't know.

74
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,870
But it's interesting.

75
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,480
Some groups come in and I find
the three or four people that

76
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,920
are sitting there I ask.

77
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,810
In and even amongst
the group, there's

78
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:39,550
somebody who's a maximalist and
somebody who's a minimalist.

79
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:43,770
So I think we're being
successful that we're not

80
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,765
going to come out all
in the same place.

81
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,780
So, of course, since we're
going to talk about the reading,

82
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,170
let's jumped through, a
letter to Jamie Dimon.

83
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:59,920
Anybody want to tell me what
you took from that letter?

84
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,810
AUDIENCE: I really
loved this article.

85
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:04,290
It is my favorite
reading so far.

86
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,105
GARY GENSLER: Oh my
gosh, 12 classes.

87
00:04:06,105 --> 00:04:06,605
All right.

88
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,250
AUDIENCE: So I though
that he really great

89
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,940
job of stripping some of the
hyperbole, both the maximalist

90
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,890
and the minimalist hyperbole
surrounding this out

91
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,000
of it to lean on
really what it is

92
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,590
and a very good explanation
of how it works.

93
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,610
And then also, the
note of caution

94
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:29,347
to see if these are the
dimensions around which--

95
00:04:29,347 --> 00:04:30,930
you should wait til
you put a word in,

96
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,780
but these are the
reasons why there's

97
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,007
potentially big implications.

98
00:04:35,007 --> 00:04:35,840
GARY GENSLER: Right.

99
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,923
And he wants to add to it.

100
00:04:36,923 --> 00:04:39,910
I'm going to hold-- there
was a hand before Alin?

101
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:40,980
AUDIENCE: Yeah, no.

102
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,897
I actually was going to
say something similar.

103
00:04:42,897 --> 00:04:48,240
But I thought he highlighted a
lot the trade-off between trust

104
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,820
and the decentralized
properties of blockchain

105
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,180
versus the cost you
must be willing to pay.

106
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,170
GARY GENSLER: And remind
me your first name.

107
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:00,980
AUDIENCE: Leonardo.

108
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,938
GARY GENSLER: Leonardo.

109
00:05:01,938 --> 00:05:02,460
All right.

110
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,960
AUDIENCE: I agree
with both of them.

111
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,015
Also, very good
writing and style.

112
00:05:08,015 --> 00:05:10,140
One thing that I didn't
like is that at some point,

113
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,330
he raised the
question, well, who

114
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,500
needs censorship resistance?

115
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,417
Because it seems like
this is the only benefit

116
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:17,140
of these decentralized
applications.

117
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,973
And he didn't answer
that question actually.

118
00:05:18,973 --> 00:05:20,807
He just gave two
vague broad answers,

119
00:05:20,807 --> 00:05:22,140
but didn't answer that question.

120
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,940
So I think that's a
really good question.

121
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,320
Who needs this stuff, anyway?

122
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,370
GARY GENSLER: All right.

123
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,440
Censorship resistance.

124
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,250
We're going to come back to it.

125
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,010
Stephanie.

126
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:30,270
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

127
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:32,490
So actually, I thought
censorship resistance was also

128
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,532
one of the more interesting
parts of this letter.

129
00:05:34,532 --> 00:05:37,560
Because to me, when you read
through what they highlighted

130
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,790
that Jamie Dimon had
said, one of the things

131
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:44,950
was people who use Bitcoin
or Blockchain are criminals.

132
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,990
And I didn't find that his
focus on censorship resistance

133
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,090
really rebutted Jamie
Dimon's argument.

134
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:55,660
GARY GENSLER: So--

135
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,210
Sean.

136
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:58,890
AUDIENCE: Oh, I think that
censorship resistance is really

137
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,320
interested in a way that
now I actually almost feel

138
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,350
why we spend so much time and
energy on trying to understand

139
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,630
public policy or
why is public policy

140
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:12,161
such a big thing in response
to decentralized apps.

141
00:06:12,161 --> 00:06:14,470
I think this is a key question.

142
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,040
GARY GENSLER: So I think of--

143
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,645
AUDIENCE: I just wanted to--
well, I definitely agree.

144
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:22,020
Because that was one of Dimon's
points, that, well, yeah,

145
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,285
if you're a criminal,
this could be useful.

146
00:06:24,285 --> 00:06:25,660
And then he talked
about how it's

147
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,035
worse than a lot of aspects
except censorship resistance.

148
00:06:28,035 --> 00:06:30,030
But I think the
analogy he used was

149
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,973
the rise in encrypted messaging
that has just become--

150
00:06:33,973 --> 00:06:35,556
it wasn't really
predictable that that

151
00:06:35,556 --> 00:06:38,050
would be such a big thing,
but now that's gotten

152
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,980
use cases in the world.

153
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,680
GARY GENSLER: So it
seems like people really

154
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,110
like the writing,
not just the style

155
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:49,795
but that it took on and
had a balanced approach.

156
00:06:49,795 --> 00:06:51,420
But you're highlighting,
wait a minute,

157
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,000
he ends with
censorship resistance,

158
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,830
but then doesn't
take it the next way.

159
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,515
Like, what does that mean?

160
00:06:57,515 --> 00:06:58,890
And so I think
we're going to try

161
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:01,650
to tease that out a little
bit, but I think of it

162
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,910
as in two ways.

163
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:04,980
It's the individual.

164
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,310
Any one of us could be
blocked from doing something.

165
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:12,240
We could not get a
service, we could not

166
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,340
be allowed to take credit if
somebody is allocating credit.

167
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,330
Think about Uber.

168
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:22,770
If Uber were censoring, we
can't get a ride any longer.

169
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:25,620
How many of us rate
everybody a five when

170
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,960
we ride our Ubers
because we think,

171
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,270
well, maybe they'll pick me up.

172
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:35,280
If I rated everybody a three,
maybe they'll censor me.

173
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,430
I don't know, but maybe you all
give more legitimate feedback.

174
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,305
I just hit five.

175
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,200
So it's the
individual censorship,

176
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,770
but I think of it as
a second thing also,

177
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:51,360
is barriers to entry, a
commercial more broad market

178
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,010
barrier.

179
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:57,090
And that in some ways,
the blockchain technology

180
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:03,030
might allow to build something
where incumbents already

181
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,320
have barriers to entry.

182
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,670
They might have used public
policy to get the barriers,

183
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:07,170
by the way.

184
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:12,930
They might have regulatory
barriers as well.

185
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,660
But more specifically,
he did define--

186
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,400
it was kind of
interesting-- crypto assets.

187
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,208
And he was one that--

188
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,250
I'm trying to remember
the gentleman who wrote it

189
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,540
because it was on Chain.

190
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,920
It was the head of Chain.

191
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,470
What's that?

192
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:27,550
AUDIENCE: Adam Ludwin.

193
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,480
GARY GENSLER: Adam Ludwin.

194
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,110
But he too said, let's not
use the word cryptocurrency.

195
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,120
Let's use the word
crypto assets.

196
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,710
They enable a
decentralized application.

197
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:42,390
And that was a key thing he was
trying to say to Jamie Dimon.

198
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,850
It depends on how
much you believe

199
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:47,380
in decentralized applications.

200
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:51,030
If you don't see a value in
decentralized applications,

201
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,420
Ludwin, said, all
right, I get it,

202
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,940
I'll agree with you, Mr. Dimon.

203
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:01,830
But there is a benefit for
decentralized applications

204
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:04,170
and a mechanism to
allocate resources

205
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,910
to a specific organization.

206
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:12,960
So some incentive way, some
way to allocate resources.

207
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,720
I would say this.

208
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,530
We've studied money
a lot this semester,

209
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:22,180
the medium of exchange, unit
of a cat, store of value.

210
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:24,840
But it's also possible that
these crypto assets have

211
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,830
some other benefit, that they're
not really truly competing

212
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:33,330
with the US dollar or
competing with the Euro,

213
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,760
but maybe they're competing
with-- who's my friend who's

214
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,970
the gamer over here?

215
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,002
Skins, yeah.

216
00:09:39,002 --> 00:09:39,960
What's your name again?

217
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,590
AUDIENCE: Mike.

218
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,382
GARY GENSLER: Mike.

219
00:09:41,382 --> 00:09:44,130
I'm going to be always
looking to my right for the--

220
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:48,840
but it could be an
incentive and be competing

221
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,570
with skins, in a sense.

222
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:55,590
And so I took that,
that, Mr. Dimon,

223
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:58,930
don't think of it only
versus the Euro or the Dollar

224
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,635
because maybe you're right.

225
00:10:00,635 --> 00:10:02,010
But it could have
something to do

226
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,760
with decentralized applications.

227
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,592
Kelly.

228
00:10:06,592 --> 00:10:10,060
AUDIENCE: To add to that,
Bitcoin is capitalism still.

229
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,182
He should love it.

230
00:10:11,182 --> 00:10:12,640
GARY GENSLER: That
you should still

231
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,030
love Bitcoin and capitalism,
and that the banks

232
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,440
aren't going away.

233
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,010
They will probably
still have banks.

234
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:21,260
AUDIENCE: It is incredible
that he didn't use the word

235
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:25,240
blockchain till the very
end to asterisk and say,

236
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,020
you'll notice I
don't use blockchain,

237
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:30,987
and I thought kind of a genius
way to separate [INAUDIBLE]..

238
00:10:30,987 --> 00:10:31,820
GARY GENSLER: Right.

239
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,750
I'm not as genius as him
because the whole course

240
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,666
is called Blockchain and Money.

241
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:38,610
[LAUGHTER]

242
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:41,530
Oh, well.

243
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:44,002
So what are decentralized
applications, at least

244
00:10:44,002 --> 00:10:44,710
in this write-up?

245
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:51,550
Anybody?

246
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,100
Kelly?

247
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,828
AUDIENCE: Basically, it just
says it allows you [INAUDIBLE]

248
00:10:54,828 --> 00:10:57,170
but without the trust part.

249
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:01,146
GARY GENSLER: So you don't need
a centralized trusted party.

250
00:11:01,146 --> 00:11:05,080
That's what in the 1990s so many
people tried and failed with,

251
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,580
in a sense.

252
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:10,020
And the internet became this
way, in a decentralized way,

253
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:12,030
to distribute packets
of information,

254
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:14,190
even though there is
centralization on the internet

255
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:18,450
as well, as we discussed
Tuesday and so forth.

256
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:21,740
But this decentralized
application-- so

257
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:25,690
in this context, he
was using it broader

258
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,830
than just something
built on top of Ethereum

259
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,030
through smart contracts.

260
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:32,630
Because he even said Bitcoin
was a decentralized application.

261
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,640
So he was using it in
the broader context,

262
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,430
not in what some people
would call dapps.

263
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:42,170
But a new model for creating
financing operating software.

264
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:45,320
And this is what Christian
Catalini wrote about as well,

265
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:51,290
that it might be that there's
a new way to finance a software

266
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,850
development.

267
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:55,250
Maybe raise some money
for the file sharing

268
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,230
before you have
the file sharing.

269
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:01,200
Might be an incentive
system as well.

270
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:06,690
And then he talked about
two structural trade-offs

271
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,310
from the design.

272
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:14,870
Now, this blockchain design
has a lot of complexity.

273
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:18,640
It has a lot of additional
cost, whether it's mining costs

274
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,240
for proof of work
or some other cost

275
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,100
to basically secure the data.

276
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,370
And so there has
to be a trade-off.

277
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:31,790
And what can pull you out of
the minimalist end of this

278
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,823
is whether there's
some benefits as well.

279
00:12:33,823 --> 00:12:35,240
And we're going
to chat about that

280
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,600
in five or 10 minutes again.

281
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,380
And then the
censorship resistance.

282
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,890
These are my words, not his.

283
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:46,430
I really do think it's
the individual censorship,

284
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:49,100
but also, what I'll
broadly call the market.

285
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,610
Are there barriers to entry
in the current system that

286
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:57,290
are, in essence, censoring
economic activity broadly,

287
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:59,520
not individually?

288
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,450
And I think, though, that
was not how he defined

289
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:03,620
it-- and I agree with Alin.

290
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,828
It would have been great if
he had written a few more

291
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:07,940
paragraphs or another page.

292
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,160
But I think it's not
just the individual,

293
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,610
it's some barriers to entry
for whole market structures.

294
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:18,580
And often, centralized
institutions,

295
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:22,750
because they have such
a networking effect,

296
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:27,580
it's hard to break in
when somebody is basically

297
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:33,010
the hub of a hub and spokes
network for almost anything.

298
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:36,490
How do you topple Facebook
at this point in time?

299
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:43,950
Because it can censor other
market activity, as an example.

300
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,570
So then we had the
McKinsey report.

301
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:51,390
Anything that people took
from yet one more survey paper

302
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,080
that you've had?

303
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,630
Akira?

304
00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:00,980
It's just because I can see
your name on the board there.

305
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:06,340
AUDIENCE: From [INAUDIBLE],, I
found the use case [INAUDIBLE]

306
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:08,840
use case to be [INAUDIBLE].

307
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,870
And one thing I
found interesting

308
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:14,860
is the switching costs.

309
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,980
Because the incumbent
financial institutions

310
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:24,726
have to think about not only the
benefit of the cost reduction,

311
00:14:24,726 --> 00:14:27,882
but also, we have to think about
[INAUDIBLE] costs, existing

312
00:14:27,882 --> 00:14:32,375
infrastructure, a lot of
the affect on the people

313
00:14:32,375 --> 00:14:33,250
watching [INAUDIBLE].

314
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,590
GARY GENSLER: So Akira's
raised a very important thing

315
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,700
about switching costs.

316
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,580
And we wrote about this, even
though I'm not detailing it

317
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:44,350
again, in the joint paper that
Simon, Johnson, and Nihon,

318
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,650
and Michael, and
Joan, and I wrote.

319
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,070
Now, this the last time--

320
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:52,415
it's the third time you had to
come back and supposedly read

321
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,040
a little bit more of
the Geneva Report.

322
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,270
But we talked there about
the switching cost as well.

323
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,320
And by the way,
to Alin's question

324
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,930
from Tuesday about
interoperability,

325
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:06,730
a lot of switching costs
relate to interoperability.

326
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,860
If you're an
institution and you're

327
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:12,400
thinking about putting in
place some blockchain solution,

328
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:17,440
permissioned or permissionless,
but how does it communicate

329
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,790
with the existing network?

330
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,710
If the Australian
stock exchange is

331
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:24,460
putting in a new back end
clearing and settlement system

332
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,930
on a blockchain--

333
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:28,900
and they are and they're
using digital asset holding--

334
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:33,100
they have to think about,
well, all of our customers

335
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,340
are currently communicating
with a legacy database system.

336
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,180
And now we're creating
a blockchain system.

337
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,400
How does that communicate?

338
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,120
How does the old system
literally move information over

339
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,660
into the new system?

340
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:53,830
And all of those from
a business perspective

341
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:58,420
are a question of how do
you operate or interoperate

342
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:03,410
with the legacy system
and all the network.

343
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,470
Because any blockchain
solution that you're

344
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:08,660
going to come up
with is likely to be

345
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:12,710
replacing some other economic
activity, and likely,

346
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:15,380
you're not going to try to
replace the entire network.

347
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,695
You're going to be surgical.

348
00:16:17,695 --> 00:16:18,695
You're going to decide--

349
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,830
I'm not trying to
give anything, Eric,

350
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:26,150
but can I say what you
all are talking about it

351
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:29,300
in your final project?

352
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,070
You have intellectual
property, so I don't

353
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,180
know if you wanted to share it.

354
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,440
But do you want to say what--

355
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,330
AUDIENCE: Could you
elaborate a little more?

356
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:38,450
In the point we were
discussing, I was kind of lost.

357
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,890
GARY GENSLER: Well,
so Eric's group--

358
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:45,290
and Brotish, and
Catalina, and Ross--

359
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:49,160
are talking about maybe doing
a permissioned blockchain

360
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:53,280
application for credit reports.

361
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,350
Not credit reports for
the commercial side,

362
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:57,240
but consumer credit.

363
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,880
Basically, an-- uh-oh, Alf.

364
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,100
Are you competing with them?

365
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:02,610
Did I just--

366
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:03,590
AUDIENCE: No, no.

367
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,660
GARY GENSLER: OK.

368
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,160
All right.

369
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,950
Maybe you are, so I
shouldn't say much more.

370
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:08,950
No, it's all right.

371
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:12,295
But I won't say anything more.

372
00:17:12,295 --> 00:17:14,520
AUDIENCE: Maybe it would
be interesting to point out

373
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,069
the fundamental--

374
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:19,440
or one of the interesting
things that comes up

375
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,810
from the discussion of
the topic we're engaging

376
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:27,839
is how to approach a
blockchain solution

377
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:33,255
from an entrepreneurial
perspective.

378
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,107
Going back to the letter to--

379
00:17:40,107 --> 00:17:41,190
GARY GENSLER: Jamie Dimon.

380
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:45,590
AUDIENCE: To Jamie
Dimon reading,

381
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,840
we're trying to get
rid of intermediaries

382
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,990
or getting economic rents with
that differing kind of paradigm

383
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:58,240
that justifies the costs of
using a blockchain approach

384
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,650
to promote [INAUDIBLE].

385
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:04,270
But from an entrepreneurial
point of view,

386
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:08,680
you would end up trying to get
some benefit from that kind

387
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,490
of implementation.

388
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:12,190
So you don't want to
replace intermediaries

389
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,360
with another intermediary.

390
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,020
So you would have to be
really creative in terms

391
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:21,460
of how to come up with really
lowering costs and gaining

392
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,360
some profits in the process.

393
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,350
GARY GENSLER: So Eric's
raising that if you're just

394
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:29,470
replacing one intermediary
with another intermediary,

395
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:31,690
will you be successful
as an entrepreneur?

396
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:35,710
Yes, if you're providing a
better service or a lower cost

397
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:39,590
structure, lower economic rents.

398
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:43,190
So I wouldn't doubt yourself.

399
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,340
I would say, we might
be able to do it.

400
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:48,470
In your use case--
and apologies,

401
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:49,670
maybe it's multiple use--

402
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:53,070
maybe it's two or three
groups thinking about it.

403
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:56,310
There's a lot of market power
right now, and thus a lot

404
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:59,490
of economic rents, but a lot of
market power and economic rents

405
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:01,320
and credit reporting.

406
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,370
Equifax, First Union, and
others earn a certain fees

407
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:08,760
for all of those FICA scores.

408
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,010
In the US, we use this.

409
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,480
If you're getting
a job, somebody

410
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,500
runs a credit report on you.

411
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,830
If you're buying an automobile
and taking out an auto loan.

412
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,760
It feels like each
of us probably

413
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,900
have a credit report pulled
on us multiple times a year.

414
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,140
Sometimes we don't even know it.

415
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,360
But back to interoperability
and switching

416
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,100
costs, just to pull
it all together.

417
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:37,830
How could you convince the
commercial banks to use--

418
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:40,020
I'll call it Eric's
project, it's

419
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:44,940
four people, but how could you
convince all the banks to use

420
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:49,380
their project and how about
all the auto dealerships

421
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:53,010
on the other side who right
now are very comfortable using

422
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:54,750
First Union?

423
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,480
Everybody's probably
paying a little bit extra.

424
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,330
And there's a fat market
power, economic rents.

425
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,260
And so that's part of
the switching costs

426
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,750
that Akira mentioned.

427
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,960
And to the
interoperability, I believe

428
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,840
they'll be more
successful if they

429
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:18,150
don't try to completely
change how data flows,

430
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,150
that at some point
you need to know

431
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:24,180
that you can't be
successful by biting off

432
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,530
too much all at once.

433
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,997
I'm sorry, Catalina.

434
00:20:28,997 --> 00:20:31,080
AUDIENCE: I was going to
say that, precisely, that

435
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,590
is one of the
forms of blockchain

436
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,780
he raised in the paper.

437
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:39,255
And it's not changing one
intermediary for another.

438
00:20:39,255 --> 00:20:41,130
Financially, what they
say is that he's going

439
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:43,490
to be more successful for--

440
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:46,825
blockchain's going to be more
successful in the permissioned

441
00:20:46,825 --> 00:20:49,740
than in the permissionless
because the incumbents are more

442
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,680
willing to work on
the permissioned

443
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:54,423
than with the permissionless.

444
00:20:54,423 --> 00:20:55,840
GARY GENSLER: In
essence, Catalina

445
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,210
is saying you might be
more successful not trying

446
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:03,390
to disrupt the entire
community, whatever

447
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:06,750
that community in some
ecosystem, some business

448
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:10,650
community, and do
it in a permissioned

449
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:11,700
versus permissionless.

450
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,190
But we're going to play
with that a little longer.

451
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:14,960
Kelly.

452
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,160
AUDIENCE: I feel like they
addressed the timeline of where

453
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,440
the strategic value is.

454
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,420
For example, they
said, currently

455
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:25,260
the best way to reap the
benefits from blockchain

456
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,450
are to focus on
this, this, and this.

457
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:30,930
And then they say, however,
feasibility at scale, they say,

458
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,067
is probably three
to five years away,

459
00:21:33,067 --> 00:21:34,400
exactly what you've been saying.

460
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:34,900
So--

461
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,410
GARY GENSLER: Oh, my god.

462
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:40,120
We could both be wrong.

463
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,650
All right.

464
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:42,535
Jack.

465
00:21:42,535 --> 00:21:44,410
AUDIENCE: Something else
I found interesting.

466
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:47,590
There's a lot of talk right now
about robotics and supply chain

467
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,770
using blockchain.

468
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:51,472
And the McKinsey report
kind of touched on that.

469
00:21:51,472 --> 00:21:52,930
No matter how secure
the blockchain

470
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:57,250
is, when you start involving
actual real products

471
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,160
and assets, it could be
completely corrupted,

472
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,920
even if the blockchain folds.

473
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,753
GARY GENSLER: Right.

474
00:22:02,753 --> 00:22:04,180
And also, it's interesting--

475
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:07,330
I think, Jack, if I can
pick further on that.

476
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:09,220
When you have something
on the blockchain,

477
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:12,280
even if it arguably
should be there,

478
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,900
it's a property
right and so forth,

479
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:19,510
but it's an off-chain asset,
it's not just a digital asset,

480
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:22,180
and secured and verified
on a blockchain.

481
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:26,410
But in supply chain, it's often
an off-chain asset, and often

482
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,240
a physical asset.

483
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,757
Then there's
additional challenges.

484
00:22:30,757 --> 00:22:32,840
I think there's some really
interesting use cases,

485
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,610
but it's a little bit
of a different place.

486
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:37,180
James.

487
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,305
And then I'm going to-- no?

488
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:44,960
So McKinsey defines
a blockchain.

489
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,450
And they point out
it doesn't have

490
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:51,440
to necessarily disintermediate
to generate value.

491
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,890
I thought that was an
interesting intuition.

492
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:58,310
Don't always think that
you have to disintermediate

493
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,150
to generate value.

494
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,942
They might be right or
they might be wrong.

495
00:23:00,942 --> 00:23:03,170
But you might
actually still end up

496
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:05,660
with something that's kind of--

497
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:09,245
as-- did Catalina say it?

498
00:23:09,245 --> 00:23:10,620
I can't remember
now who said it,

499
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,310
but they also said
they gave a timescale.

500
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,620
A short term value
might be predominantly--

501
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:20,360
Kelly did, sorry-- three
to five years away.

502
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,600
How to capture value.

503
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,550
Be pragmatic and
skeptical, but you

504
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:30,458
need to go down to
a granular level.

505
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:32,000
And that's also what
I'm going to ask

506
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,460
you to do in the
final paper, is really

507
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:37,640
to challenge yourself,
challenge your group

508
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,400
to go down to the granular
level and say, wait,

509
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,040
what transactions
are we actually going

510
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,990
to change the flow?

511
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:48,050
What ledger system
might we shift?

512
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:50,750
And even though it's
the back office--

513
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,640
and to some people,
you might say, oh,

514
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,280
my god, that's kind of the
boring side of business.

515
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,200
But that's really what
blockchain is about.

516
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,920
It's a database and ledger
management system also.

517
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,130
And to be successful,
you have to get down

518
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:08,960
to that granular level
and figure it out

519
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,820
in terms of whatever
that current ecosystem is

520
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,715
or the regulatory system.

521
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:22,390
They said it's particularly
valuable in low trust

522
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,070
environments.

523
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:26,380
And that could be
where currently we

524
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:30,040
can't trade directly and you've
created a new way to do peer

525
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:34,150
to peer, or where
there's not currently

526
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:38,150
a central intermediary.

527
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,290
You can go right at it.

528
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:42,260
You could be like this
bold group that says,

529
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:46,940
I want to take on Transunion,
I want to take on Equifax.

530
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:51,110
That's something which is a
central intermediary right now.

531
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:54,880
But it is correct, we're
not really trading directly.

532
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:01,790
It's not like when I walk into
the auto shop or to buy a car

533
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:04,280
and I'm going to take a loan
out that I can transact.

534
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,470
They want to validate that I
can pay back that darn loan.

535
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:10,880
Yes?

536
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,220
AUDIENCE: Just two points,
particularly the fact where

537
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,075
your--

538
00:25:15,075 --> 00:25:16,810
well, you can't
trade directly now,

539
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,780
but there's a lot
of trade happening

540
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,310
where you don't have
an intermediary,

541
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:23,825
but some sort of
intermediary would help.

542
00:25:23,825 --> 00:25:26,723
I couldn't help but think
of ag markets in very--

543
00:25:26,723 --> 00:25:28,765
GARY GENSLER: You're saying
ag, like agriculture?

544
00:25:28,765 --> 00:25:32,780
AUDIENCE: Agriculture markets in
very remote parts of the world,

545
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,740
where actually being networked.

546
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,320
And precisely, there's no trust.

547
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,210
That kind of environment exists.

548
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:44,190
So a good use case for
that, extreme remote parts

549
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:47,640
of the world where internet
is there, but not necessarily

550
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,087
financial institutions or
regulatory environments.

551
00:25:50,087 --> 00:25:50,920
GARY GENSLER: Right.

552
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,310
And there are many parts,
particularly in the third world

553
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,870
that are still unbanked.

554
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:59,040
I've said this statistic before,
but the World Bank report

555
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:05,310
on banking in 2017, half
of sub-Saharan African

556
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:08,650
was still unbanked.

557
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:12,280
But half of that half
has mobile phones.

558
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:17,400
So it's just-- those gaps might
change, but then it will move.

559
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,400
Yes, they might have
a banking account,

560
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,280
but it would be not
something they can really

561
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,970
do with agriculture.

562
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:26,765
So two opportunities--
and I'm going

563
00:26:26,765 --> 00:26:28,690
to come to the
question-- is like,

564
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:31,180
do you go head-on against
a central intermediary

565
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,220
and use this technology
to do it better?

566
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,658
[PHONE RINGING]

567
00:26:34,658 --> 00:26:35,200
Look at that.

568
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,310
I should turn this off.

569
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,400
Head-on against a
central intermediary?

570
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,020
Or some market structure
that has no really core

571
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:52,420
intermediary, but you can
build a better trustless

572
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,700
peer to peer network?

573
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,160
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
[INAUDIBLE] that's

574
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,390
when it comes to
private permission.

575
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:04,290
Architectural blockchain,
it's highly likely

576
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,630
to be more scalable.

577
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,480
Why is that?

578
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:10,510
GARY GENSLER: Highly likely
to be more scalable, yes.

579
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:16,600
So permissioned blockchains,
they've made a trade-off.

580
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:19,570
So Nakamoto's paper comes out.

581
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:21,970
For a few years, people
don't really notice it.

582
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:26,830
But then it starts
to get some lift

583
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:31,030
and folks are looking
at it in 2013 to 2015.

584
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:34,120
And the financial industry
starts to think about this

585
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,928
and says, this actually
is pretty interesting.

586
00:27:37,928 --> 00:27:39,470
We're not sure what
it's going to do,

587
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:40,960
but we're pretty interested.

588
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,870
And they get attracted to
it because it might be a way

589
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:47,050
to move data around, it might
be able to literally lower

590
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:49,720
the costs of the back office.

591
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:54,220
Many banks keeping the
same set of records--

592
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,910
I have an equity
trading business,

593
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,430
you have an equity
trading business.

594
00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:01,880
We both have to confirm
and correct those records.

595
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:06,050
But we keep full databases.

596
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:10,410
What they found
attractive was real.

597
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:12,320
But then remember,
Bitcoin can only

598
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,560
do seven transactions a second.

599
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:22,610
So all of those challenges of
scalability, privacy, security

600
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:24,350
led them to think
about, was there

601
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:27,380
a way that we could
literally toss

602
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:31,490
some of the technical
things over the side?

603
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:35,100
And most of them thought, we
don't need a native token.

604
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,260
We don't need an
incentive structure.

605
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:43,490
And if we limit the number
of nodes in the network,

606
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:45,650
we can increase
scalability and we

607
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:47,740
can get rid of proof of work.

608
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:53,940
So my narrative
might not matter,

609
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,440
but it's important
to understand it.

610
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,800
The permissionless thing comes
along, and then they say,

611
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,850
it's not scalable.

612
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:04,140
What can we toss overboard
and make it scalable?

613
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,910
And what they tossed overboard--

614
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,410
they didn't even feel they
needed the native token,

615
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:12,270
and they tossed overboard
proof of work, consensus,

616
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:15,070
and had a club deal.

617
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:17,920
In the Australian
stock exchange example,

618
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,990
they might only have
two or three nodes.

619
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:23,090
But in some of these,
there's 15 or 20.

620
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:25,640
So why is it more scalable?

621
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:30,290
Fewer nodes and much more
efficient consensus mechanisms.

622
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:32,630
But the trade-off is
you better damn well

623
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:36,300
trust now those 15 or 20 nodes.

624
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,400
And when we talk
about 51% attacks,

625
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,270
you could revise a whole
permissioned blockchain

626
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:46,480
if those 15 parties wanted to.

627
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,340
Now, some people say, well, you
could just do a hash function.

628
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,040
Remember that whole hashing.

629
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,280
You could do a hash function of
a whole permissioned blockchain

630
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,650
once a day, once a
week, once an hour

631
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:58,400
and store it somewhere else.

632
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:02,620
In fact, you could store the
hash of all of that on Bitcoin.

633
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,570
You could use a
ledger like Bitcoin

634
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:07,360
and just store it there.

635
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,385
So there's some feedback loops.

636
00:30:10,385 --> 00:30:11,010
Does that help?

637
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,800
Give you a sense?

638
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,920
AUDIENCE: I was also just
going to build on that.

639
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,790
So the power of a
permissioned blockchain

640
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:22,450
is that, unlike Ethereum or
Bitcoin, it's not public.

641
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:24,055
So there is no public ledger.

642
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:26,530
You can make it public,
but it's permissioned, not

643
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:27,400
permissionless.

644
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,490
Because you need to have trusted
entities in this network.

645
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:35,670
So this can also
be, you could say,

646
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:39,670
a feature, not a bug
when it comes to scaling.

647
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:43,780
Because essentially,
you control the scale.

648
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:46,570
So you control these nodes.

649
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:49,060
And then like
mentioned, these nodes

650
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:52,120
are only relevant
because they are

651
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,600
trusted pieces of this puzzle.

652
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,450
Yeah.

653
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:57,760
AUDIENCE: Right.

654
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,680
I think it's easier
to get scale,

655
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:04,780
but there is not a
large enough market

656
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:08,080
to actually make
it scale or make

657
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,990
it reach to the critical mass.

658
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:15,220
GARY GENSLER: So are you
worried that there's not

659
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:18,660
enough to get to
the critical mass?

660
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,510
Now, I'm not sure--

661
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:27,620
so a permissionless blockchain
and a permissioned blockchain

662
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,380
both can be open
to public users.

663
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:36,350
You can have millions of people
use a permissioned blockchain,

664
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:41,290
but only 15 have the right
to amend the records.

665
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,490
So one might think
of who has a right

666
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:46,760
to read it, who has a
right to write on it.

667
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,950
Read, write.

668
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:54,560
But also, absent even that,
it might provide a service,

669
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:57,920
like file sharing
or some service.

670
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,870
There might even be
a third list of who

671
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,670
has a right to use the service.

672
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:04,070
Now, usually to use a
service, you actually

673
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,180
have to read the data.

674
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:10,057
But you could partition and say,
how much can be read as well.

675
00:32:10,057 --> 00:32:11,640
Yes, and remind me
of your first name.

676
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:11,950
I'm sorry.

00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:12,970

680
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,570
I really appreciate
your perspective

681
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:22,213
from how you
envision [INAUDIBLE]

682
00:32:22,213 --> 00:32:23,130
permissioned projects.

683
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:24,630
GARY GENSLER: The

684
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:27,850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] in
terms of its relationship with

685
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:29,640
[INAUDIBLE].

686
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:35,040
Do you think it
would pave the way

687
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,350
towards the true
decentralization eventually?

688
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:45,680
Or you were just [INAUDIBLE]
Or you would just

689
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:50,240
become irrelevant just as the
intranet compared to internet.

690
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,660
GARY GENSLER: So [INAUDIBLE]
question is unanswerable,

691
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:57,860
but I'll try to give my opinion
in 2018, and then we'll see.

692
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:03,120
And it's being recorded,
so we'll see how I'll do.

693
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,910
But the question
really is, what's

694
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:07,760
the relationship for
permissioned and permissionless

695
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,680
blockchains?

696
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:12,080
And what is it going
to be longer term?

697
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,790
I think today in 2018, because
of the scalability issues

698
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:19,040
and some of the
privacy and security

699
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:24,440
issues, the dominant place
that the investment will

700
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,350
be is on the permissioned
side, especially

701
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:30,710
with what's called enterprise
applications, the banks,

702
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:32,600
the large institutions.

703
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:37,580
There's not enough scalability
because 1,000 users a day

704
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:40,940
or 1,500 users a
day on the big apps

705
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,100
right now on the Ethereum
network, that's just not

706
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:50,390
enough beyond gaming sites
and some small hobbyist type

707
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:53,990
things, like CryptoKitties.

708
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:56,390
It's fun, it's
interesting, but it's not

709
00:33:56,390 --> 00:34:01,111
truly scalable to 7 billion
people living around the globe.

710
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,270
But I wouldn't-- and I've
said this to some IBM folks.

711
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:13,000
And they have 1,000 people at
IBM in the hyper ledger team.

712
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,400
Anybody who is a
blockchain minimalist--

713
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,002
you haven't heard this number?

714
00:34:17,002 --> 00:34:18,556
AUDIENCE: I've heard 2,500.

715
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:19,389
GARY GENSLER: 2,500?

716
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:19,889
All right.

717
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:22,000
So it's more than I thought.

718
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,260
So 1,000 to 2,500.

719
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:26,260
I knew it was more than 1,000.

720
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,969
IBM is throwing a
lot of money there.

721
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:32,820
Now, they might be doing
that to protect their risk.

722
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,150
They might be investing even
if all those 1,000 people

723
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:38,850
ultimately produce nothing.

724
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:43,050
But I think that five years from
now or seven years from now,

725
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:45,670
the gap will close.

726
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:48,219
I think that permissionless
systems will always

727
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:52,270
have a lot of challenge about
governance, collective action.

728
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:55,300
How you have collective
action is not just

729
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:59,800
a matter of technical and
coding and smart scientist

730
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,995
at MIT and elsewhere.

731
00:35:02,995 --> 00:35:04,870
I think that's going to
still be a challenge,

732
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:07,080
and there will be trade-offs.

733
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,240
So it might be
that they coexist,

734
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,820
but I think the gap will close.

735
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:15,150
And you said, well, will it
be like the intranet went away

736
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,410
and the internet was there.

737
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:18,870
There are some people
that believe that.

738
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:20,820
And that might be--

739
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,930
I'm probably not there.

740
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:24,000
I'm probably not
all the way there.

741
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,790
But I think when
the gap closes, some

742
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:29,940
of these permissioned systems
will not be as necessary.

743
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,800
Zero knowledge
proofs, other ways

744
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,190
that come along that
make it more usable.

745
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:36,352
Yes, Zann.

746
00:35:36,352 --> 00:35:37,560
AUDIENCE: Totally understood.

747
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:41,370
I'm a little bit skeptical on
the permissioned blockchains.

748
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:42,900
One of the--

749
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,280
GARY GENSLER: Are
you skeptical--

750
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,660
if I can interrupt you--

751
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,150
and thus it moves you over
to traditional databases?

752
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:51,270
Or skeptical and you're moved
over to permissionless open?

753
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,420
So I don't know, which
way is it pushing you?

754
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,920
AUDIENCE: Depending
on the use case.

755
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,510
For enterprises, I think
traditional databases

756
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,230
for the enterprise use case.

757
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:02,790
Reading here, this
line killed me.

758
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:05,970
It said, "Accenture developed
immutable blockchain

759
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:07,890
in which the content
of individual blocks

760
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:10,440
can be modified."

761
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:14,040
It's a ridiculous statement
considering the definition

762
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,680
of blockchain is anti--

763
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,310
this is the antithesis
of basically--

764
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:19,143
GARY GENSLER: Right.

765
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:22,110
So Accenture created an
immutable blockchain that

766
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:27,300
isn't immutable, is what you're
saying, it can be amended.

767
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:31,290
So it's a backdoor I can change.

768
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:35,700
And yet, the economics of it
is that a lot of times, people

769
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,830
do want a backdoor.

770
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:41,580
And the challenges-- and these
are the weaknesses as well,

771
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,800
as Nouriel Roubini says.

772
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,140
Why would you create a
system where if you forget

773
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,840
your private key,
lose your private key,

774
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:52,110
or the cave collapses-- that
you're hiding the private key

775
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:54,960
in a cave and maybe it floods--

776
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,340
that you've lost your assets?

777
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,548
Wouldn't you want a backdoor?

778
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:06,120
But I respect-- you would say
this isn't even a blockchain.

779
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,670
I'm trying to teach this
class in a little bit

780
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:12,690
neutral between permissionless
and permissioned blockchains.

781
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:14,640
But you need
something to get out

782
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,723
of the traditional databases.

783
00:37:16,723 --> 00:37:19,140
And I've chosen, at least for
purposes of this class, that

784
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,120
means you've got to
have an append-only log,

785
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,430
you have to have time stamping.

786
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:27,690
So the basis of multiple
people writing to the ledger,

787
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:30,480
even if it's only three or five.

788
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,105
But these are not
well-defined vocabulary terms.

789
00:37:35,105 --> 00:37:35,605
Alin.

790
00:37:35,605 --> 00:37:37,605
AUDIENCE: This is why we
should stop using them.

791
00:37:37,605 --> 00:37:39,810
And this is a
perfect opportunity

792
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:41,930
to actually talk about
append-only ledgers

793
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:43,430
because that's
actually meaningful--

794
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:45,555
a meaningful notion that's
been studied in computer

795
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:46,830
science for decades.

796
00:37:46,830 --> 00:37:48,630
Or consensus
algorithms, which is

797
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,640
another meaningful notion
studied in computer

798
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:51,870
science for decades.

799
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:56,550
And consensus algorithms on
append-only ledgers, sometimes

800
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:58,633
referred to colloquially
as blockchain,

801
00:37:58,633 --> 00:38:01,050
and then we would know what
are we actually talking about.

802
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:02,203
If we--

803
00:38:02,203 --> 00:38:03,600
[LAUGHTER]

804
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,790
GARY GENSLER: Well,
I will try to help.

805
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:08,370
But we're only 80 people,
and there is a lot

806
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:09,960
of people using these terms.

807
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:12,150
And when you go outside
of this class or even

808
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:15,900
when you read an open
letter to Jamie Dimon--

809
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:23,580
of the somewhere between 25
and 50 readings you had so far

810
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:26,760
this semester, they've
used the word blockchain

811
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,720
in multiple ways.

812
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,040
I'm agreeing with you.

813
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,500
You're just asking me not to
ever use the word blockchain

814
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,000
again?

815
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,710
AUDIENCE: Yes.

816
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,677
GARY GENSLER: Oh, my god.

817
00:38:34,677 --> 00:38:36,510
And he's sitting in the
center of the class.

818
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:39,210
Let's keep going.

819
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:41,280
So we're going to study these.

820
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,750
This is just this list
that we've talked about.

821
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:47,580
But in Act Three, we're going
to come to it after SIP week

822
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:51,150
and start to go through
venture capital payment systems

823
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:52,670
and so forth.

824
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,420
It might be some of
what you're picking up

825
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:57,630
for the final projects.

826
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:02,677
But here-- and I stress the
word, potential use cases.

827
00:39:02,677 --> 00:39:03,510
Will these all work?

828
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:05,640
Will they be places?

829
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:10,210
In the non-financial space,
supply chain management

830
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:12,480
I put on this list, but
it's kind of financial

831
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,500
and I wanted to include it.

832
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:18,510
Digital identity is both within
finance and outside of finance.

833
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:21,210
Property and asset registries--
you can call it finance,

834
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:24,810
but I'm not going to
dig into that a lot

835
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:26,370
in the rest of the semester.

836
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:30,690
Medical records, internet
of things, and so forth.

837
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:32,250
This isn't going
to be exhaustive.

838
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:38,520
If you come on Tuesday, October
30, to the Bitcoin blockchain

839
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,600
dinner that Simon
Johnson sponsors,

840
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,080
we'll have somebody doing
election and voting.

841
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:47,520
So there's a lot of other
interesting applications.

842
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,130
I tend to be a little
doubtful about the voting

843
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:53,640
because I think official sector
and governments want something

844
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,520
so centralized in that.

845
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:01,470
But maybe it will be
more decentralized.

846
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:04,350
Maybe it's append-only
without a consensus.

847
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,980
McKinsey, they broke it
down into six buckets.

848
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:15,230
They had the record keeping
and the transaction-based.

849
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:17,820
And a lot of these are
the similar buckets.

850
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:23,060
It's just to give a
spur to all of it.

851
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:29,080
So accessing costs and benefits.

852
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,960
So we've talked about
what are the benefits.

853
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:34,140
These are the questions
that I would be saying.

854
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,110
And some of this was
in the Geneva Report,

855
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:38,340
but rather than
trying to tease it out

856
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:46,920
of all of the discussion, here
I would lay out four big buckets

857
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:51,690
as to how I think about this and
how I might get your feedback.

858
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:53,700
If you see other
ways to look at this,

859
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:56,990
I want to learn from
you all as well.

860
00:40:56,990 --> 00:40:59,280
And when I say four,
this is the first bucket.

861
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,910
Basically, what are the benefits
of using this technology?

862
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:08,400
Whether it's this idea about
consumer credit or some of you

863
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,880
have had ideas about
government procurement

864
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:18,300
or payments, wherever you
are, what is the true benefit?

865
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,730
You've got to find a pain point.

866
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:23,530
Every entrepreneur always has
to find a pain point, something

867
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:27,180
that you can be solving it
for a group of stakeholders.

868
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:32,200
And who are the stakeholders
you're solving something for?

869
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:36,820
Or if you're a company, is
it an internal pain point?

870
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:39,160
Pain point is some
constraint to making

871
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,950
more profits, more revenues.

872
00:41:41,950 --> 00:41:44,500
Or it's a friction,
it's a cost and you

873
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,780
want to get rid of a cost.

874
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:50,500
But what is the pain point
for providing a good service

875
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:53,120
or making more money?

876
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:56,250
How can you capture the value?

877
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:58,560
As an entrepreneur,
if you do something

878
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,230
for eleemosynary
purposes, meaning

879
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:03,360
you don't care
about making money,

880
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:05,070
I applaud that, that's terrific.

881
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:08,490
You can even hand that in
for your final project.

882
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:12,420
But I'm assuming that you're
going to be thinking like me,

883
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:14,550
how do you capture value?

884
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:18,150
Not only do something, but
also capture that value

885
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:22,110
and get a little of somebody
else's economic rents

886
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:24,330
if possible.

887
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:26,518
Thirdly, what are the
competition doing?

888
00:42:26,518 --> 00:42:27,810
What are the competitors doing?

889
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:30,060
Even if they're using
traditional databases,

890
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:36,580
how are they addressing the
same pain point in anything

891
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:37,760
you're doing?

892
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,030
And why is blockchain
technology--

893
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,960
or, as Alin would
wish me to say,

894
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:46,510
why are append-only longs
and consensus protocols--

895
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:47,860
what is the answer?

896
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:51,640
What is it about append-only
logs with their time

897
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:55,480
stamping, with their
final settlement,

898
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:59,470
the finality of that
settlement, what about that?

899
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:04,330
Or even a full consensus
protocol and a native currency.

900
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:07,150
So I'd add a third thing because
permissionless would also

901
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:10,480
have an incentive system
in a native currency.

902
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,330
So what is it about append-only
logs, consensus protocol,

903
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:16,430
and a native currency?

904
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:17,260
How am I doing?

905
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,177
AUDIENCE: I love this.

906
00:43:18,177 --> 00:43:19,510
GARY GENSLER: You love it, yeah.

907
00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:21,094
AUDIENCE: Talk like
this all the time.

908
00:43:21,094 --> 00:43:22,042
Don't forget it.

909
00:43:22,042 --> 00:43:24,840
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

910
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,028
Oh, my god.

911
00:43:26,028 --> 00:43:27,940
[LAUGHTER]

912
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:31,020
Oh, I need this.

913
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:32,920
But that's the core.

914
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:36,790
And I talk about it
being the final project,

915
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:40,330
but this is going on right
now. $28 billion dollars

916
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:43,120
has been raised in
initial coin offerings

917
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,520
and a few extra billion,
3 or 4 other billion

918
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,550
has been raised by direct
venture capital in this world,

919
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:52,090
but call it $30 billion.

920
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:56,020
It's not fully mature,
but it's maturing,

921
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:58,840
and a lot of venture capitalists
are saying, wait a minute,

922
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:02,200
wait a minute, we're
past the hype stage.

923
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:04,330
What pain point are
you trying to address?

924
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:06,010
How are you creating value?

925
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:08,360
What are the competitions doing?

926
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:13,330
And why do you need append-only
logs, consensus protocols,

927
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:15,797
and possibly native tokens?

928
00:44:15,797 --> 00:44:18,130
AUDIENCE: I just wanted to
follow-up on that point about

929
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:18,755
the Accenture--

930
00:44:18,755 --> 00:44:20,463
GARY GENSLER: You're
not going to tell me

931
00:44:20,463 --> 00:44:21,640
how to define something?

932
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:24,245
All right, Kelly.

933
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:27,612
AUDIENCE: The Accenture thing
he was talking about from the--

934
00:44:27,612 --> 00:44:29,810
GARY GENSLER: It's
immutable but amendable.

935
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:30,550
AUDIENCE: Right.

936
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:32,380
So we ask ourselves
the question--

937
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:33,602
that seems a little bit--

938
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:39,020
it defeats the purpose, right?

939
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:44,090
So I then ask myself, what value
is being created by doing that?

940
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:50,840
If it's not necessarily
for their customers,

941
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,863
where is the
internal value lying?

942
00:44:53,863 --> 00:44:56,030
GARY GENSLER: I don't know
what the application was.

943
00:44:56,030 --> 00:45:07,240
But I think that in every
application that we find,

944
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:11,580
not just in blockchain
but in other applications,

945
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:15,900
you have to ask absolute
final settlement.

946
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:20,690
If you can never amend it,
if it is truly immutable,

947
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:23,810
what cost does that also make?

948
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:25,880
I assume that in
this application

949
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,650
that was too great
a cost for them

950
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:29,960
and they wanted
a backdoor, a way

951
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:34,160
to amend that which was
supposed to be immutable.

952
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,020
Again, I don't know
that application.

953
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:37,430
But that is one of the--

954
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:39,410
I think it's a
feature of blockchain.

955
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:41,390
But it's both a
feature and, to some,

956
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:45,160
a bug that you cannot
amend something.

957
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:46,190
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

958
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:49,210
It says that one
of the benefits was

959
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:51,160
that it allowed different
entities involved

960
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,630
to draw on the same record.

961
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:55,480
So yeah, of course, I can
see where that's valuable.

962
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,708
But then it also
begs the question,

963
00:45:57,708 --> 00:45:59,500
if you want to change
it, then why not just

964
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:01,170
use a traditional database?

965
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:05,450
GARY GENSLER: Vitalik
Buterin in 2016

966
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:11,950
helped when an organization
called DAO, the DAO--

967
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:15,430
is it Decentralized
Autonomous Organization?

968
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:17,570
Thank you for those who--

969
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:20,780
it was one of the largest at
the time initial coin offerings.

970
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:24,490
It raised about $160 US million.

971
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:29,330
And very quickly, right
in the smart contract--

972
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:31,240
it wasn't in the
base Ethereum layer,

973
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:33,970
but I believe it was in
the smart contract on top,

974
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:37,900
somebody saw what has
later been called a bug.

975
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,820
I don't know if
it's truly a bug.

976
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:42,730
It was programmed
in, in a sense,

977
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:45,790
but there was a way that they
could see how to get in there.

978
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:48,630
And they took about a
third of the tokens,

979
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:51,550
so the equivalent of
about $50 million.

980
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:53,110
But the way the
programming worked,

981
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:57,340
there was about two weeks before
it actually was truly final.

982
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:01,780
It was something in the code
also, and that wasn't a bug.

983
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:06,130
And the whole Ethereum
community was debating it.

984
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:10,130
And Vitalik Buterin said,
no, we can't let this happen.

985
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:12,880
So in a sense,
they big footed it.

986
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,130
They almost did what Essentia.

987
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:16,900
Now, he might say,
no, actually, it

988
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:22,000
was right at the 11th
hour and 59th minute

989
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,340
because there was this
10-day or two-week period.

990
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:28,570
But they basically, Vitalik
Buterin even did kind of what

991
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:30,492
Essentia did at that moment.

992
00:47:30,492 --> 00:47:32,034
AUDIENCE: They forked
it then, right?

993
00:47:34,587 --> 00:47:35,920
GARY GENSLER: I don't even know.

994
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,160
Was it a technical fork
because of how they did it?

995
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,232
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

996
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:41,690
GARY GENSLER: Right
at that moment.

997
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:44,372
AUDIENCE: Ethereum classic
still has the DAO--

998
00:47:44,372 --> 00:47:46,510
GARY GENSLER: The
stolen $50 million

999
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:48,200
or whatever, the
number of tokens.

1000
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:51,590
So that led to the fork.

1001
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:56,280
The majority of the
community went with Vitalik

1002
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:00,000
rather than what
the fork happened.

1003
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:06,320
So how immutable is immutable
if there's a broad consensus?

1004
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:09,440
Now that's the
backdoor, in a sense.

1005
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,690
Second-- was there another hand?

1006
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:13,200
I'm sorry, Brodish.

1007
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,220
AUDIENCE: I think
the [INAUDIBLE]

1008
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:19,340
GARY GENSLER: To address
Kelly's and Zann's.

1009
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:21,117
AUDIENCE: And the
word blockchain.

1010
00:48:21,117 --> 00:48:22,700
GARY GENSLER: And
the word blockchain.

1011
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:23,660
All right.

1012
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:26,300
AUDIENCE: So I think when people
are talking about blockchain

1013
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,460
as a term, they're
essentially referring

1014
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:32,060
to a set of potential
benefits of this technology.

1015
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:34,530
And some of them can be relevant
for a particular use case.

1016
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:36,405
Some of them might
[INAUDIBLE],, some of them

1017
00:48:36,405 --> 00:48:40,260
might actually [INAUDIBLE]
for that particular use case.

1018
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:42,530
So the way it can
be thought of is

1019
00:48:42,530 --> 00:48:45,670
that we have an umbrella term
which talks about referring

1020
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:46,940
potential benefits.

1021
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:48,740
We take what is
[? referred ?] from that.

1022
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:51,430
It could be append-only, it
could be not append-only,

1023
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:53,510
it could be consensus,
it could be permission,

1024
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:54,740
permissionless, whatever.

1025
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:57,690
And then we cannot calibrate
with them and create a solution

1026
00:48:57,690 --> 00:49:00,950
which is applicable for the
particular use case that I want

1027
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:03,110
to look at.

1028
00:49:03,110 --> 00:49:05,810
That is why even if
it is not immutable,

1029
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:07,940
it is still a potential
use of blockchain,

1030
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:09,530
from my understanding.

1031
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:12,730
Because we are bringing up some
of the benefits of the umbrella

1032
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:13,730
term.

1033
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:19,430
GARY GENSLER: I
think you're correct,

1034
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:23,420
but I'm not going to go all
the way to where you are.

1035
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:26,420
I think you're correct
that, broadly speaking,

1036
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:31,280
many people are using
this term to promote

1037
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,130
their own innovation, the
innovation of their colleagues,

1038
00:49:34,130 --> 00:49:36,050
and so forth.

1039
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:39,120
And yet, some want a
backdoor, like Essentia,

1040
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:40,680
and make it less immutable.

1041
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:43,220
And so all of a sudden,
if it has a big backdoor

1042
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:47,990
and you can amend, is it really
an append-only log any longer?

1043
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:52,850
What I do want to say is, in
this class, I am going to say,

1044
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:55,770
anything you're working
on for your final paper,

1045
00:49:55,770 --> 00:50:00,430
it has to be at least a
permissioned or permissionless

1046
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:01,120
system.

1047
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:03,010
Thus it has to have a--

1048
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:04,114
what's that?

1049
00:50:04,114 --> 00:50:04,990
AUDIENCE: Not mine.

1050
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:05,530
GARY GENSLER: Not yours?

1051
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:06,680
But you're going to get there.

1052
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,230
You're going to
get there, Brodish.

1053
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:09,950
You're going to get there.

1054
00:50:09,950 --> 00:50:16,720
Since I told you earlier
in the day, get to yes.

1055
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:22,150
But if it's a
traditional database,

1056
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:26,020
I'm saying stretch your minds,
try to figure out something.

1057
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:27,910
Even if it's got a
little bit of risk

1058
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:32,230
into it as to how you get
to using append-only logs,

1059
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:36,040
and even in a permissioned
closed loose private consensus,

1060
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:37,660
but some consensus.

1061
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:39,720
Think about whether
you use a token that

1062
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:40,720
gets the permissionless.

1063
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:41,220
Uh-oh.

1064
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:43,310
Eric's going to plead his case.

1065
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:48,497
AUDIENCE: I'm just going to try
to completely reconcile this.

1066
00:50:48,497 --> 00:50:50,330
GARY GENSLER: And then
I need to keep going.

1067
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:51,070
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1068
00:50:51,070 --> 00:50:53,697
Those two apparently
divergent points--

1069
00:50:53,697 --> 00:50:55,280
GARY GENSLER: Right,
Brotish and Alin.

1070
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:55,930
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1071
00:50:55,930 --> 00:50:58,630
AUDIENCE: I actually
agree with Brotish.

1072
00:50:58,630 --> 00:50:59,860
AUDIENCE: The point is that--

1073
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:02,085
GARY GENSLER: That he
might agree with him.

1074
00:51:02,085 --> 00:51:03,460
AUDIENCE: I'm
still in the middle

1075
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:07,780
because from a technical
standpoint, it's true.

1076
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:11,770
You have append-only log
in a consensus mechanism

1077
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:16,300
that make up the
original use case that

1078
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:18,693
brought the term blockchain.

1079
00:51:18,693 --> 00:51:20,610
GARY GENSLER: Plus a
native token in that one.

1080
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:21,756
AUDIENCE: Yeah, of course.

1081
00:51:21,756 --> 00:51:25,330
[INAUDIBLE] But to the
point, though, what

1082
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:29,410
happens if you want to
change or amend the log?

1083
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:31,000
Then is that really
a blockchain?

1084
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,860
That's exactly the reason
why the term [INAUDIBLE]

1085
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:38,560
later technologies came up.

1086
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:43,570
Because to a certain
purist extent,

1087
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:47,980
it's not an append-only
log because you're actually

1088
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:52,830
updating it from a
purist definition.

1089
00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:54,090
That makes sense, of course.

1090
00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:58,870
But then the nature of
a distributed database

1091
00:51:58,870 --> 00:52:03,640
that's not located
in an intranet

1092
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:09,000
that governs the updates and
whatever changes you make it,

1093
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:14,185
it's the reason that make up
these ledger technologies that

1094
00:52:14,185 --> 00:52:16,750
are blockchain
inspired, if you may.

1095
00:52:16,750 --> 00:52:23,560
So it's OK, you can say
if you amend the log,

1096
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:24,830
then it's not blockchain.

1097
00:52:24,830 --> 00:52:28,420
Right, but it's DLT, and the
DLT is blockchain inspired.

1098
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:32,078
So we can keep everything
in the neighborhood.

1099
00:52:32,078 --> 00:52:34,120
GARY GENSLER: We're going
to keep this discussion

1100
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:35,170
and debate going.

1101
00:52:35,170 --> 00:52:37,660
And we're probably
not all that far off.

1102
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:39,370
It's not about
vocabulary, it's also

1103
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:44,050
about I'm trying to spur you all
to get to yes, even if you're

1104
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:45,550
a minimalist.

1105
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:49,360
Think about some project that
uses the essence of this,

1106
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,790
and not just inspired.

1107
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:56,275
So then what are the specifics
of this append-only log

1108
00:52:56,275 --> 00:53:01,930
and consensus use case
or blockchain use case?

1109
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:04,970
So what cost of
verification or networking

1110
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:07,060
are you actually reducing?

1111
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:10,522
Back to Catalini's work
about verification cost

1112
00:53:10,522 --> 00:53:12,730
and networking costs that
we talked about on Tuesday.

1113
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:16,210
What is that cost you're
actually reducing?

1114
00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:18,640
Which transactions
need to be recorded?

1115
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,800
What accounts or
transactions, you might say,

1116
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,070
need to be recorded on this log?

1117
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:26,260
What stakeholders need
to be able to write?

1118
00:53:26,260 --> 00:53:30,760
If there's only one stakeholder
that needs to update something,

1119
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:32,860
I'm not really entirely
sure that you'd

1120
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:36,280
be in this distributed
decentralized place.

1121
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:41,610
So I list these questions
that weren't directly

1122
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:43,620
in the readings, but
I list these questions

1123
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:48,030
to say this is a way to start
to get your mind around where

1124
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:52,230
this technology,
however we label it,

1125
00:53:52,230 --> 00:53:54,210
this technology can help.

1126
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:57,630
In essence, does it lower cost
of verification and networking?

1127
00:53:57,630 --> 00:53:58,878
And if so, which ones?

1128
00:53:58,878 --> 00:54:00,420
Which ones are you
trying to address?

1129
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:03,360
Which ones are you trying
to dig and basically create

1130
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:06,280
value for your startup?

1131
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:09,640
What transactions or accounts
are you trying to record?

1132
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:12,010
Transactions, like
changing property rights

1133
00:54:12,010 --> 00:54:15,340
or moving around birth
records or land records

1134
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:16,810
or supply chain.

1135
00:54:16,810 --> 00:54:18,640
But where's that?

1136
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:22,150
Which stakeholders actually need
to write to this distributed

1137
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:23,337
ledger?

1138
00:54:23,337 --> 00:54:24,670
Because if it's only one party--

1139
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:29,230
I'm still trying to get my head
around why the Australian Stock

1140
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:31,556
Exchange really
needs it, but OK.

1141
00:54:31,556 --> 00:54:35,920
What is it that
multiple parties need

1142
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:41,710
to write to this shared
collective state of what

1143
00:54:41,710 --> 00:54:43,150
is there?

1144
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:46,210
And then the last one is
also terribly important,

1145
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:49,180
is, what's the customer
user interface?

1146
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:53,710
And a lot of challenges
are basically like,

1147
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:55,240
currently we're not
in a place where

1148
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:58,090
a lot of blockchain
applications are distributed,

1149
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:00,800
applications have great
customer user interfaces.

1150
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:05,950
But that as well.

1151
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:08,050
Then what are the cost
of the transitions?

1152
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:10,512
Akira mentioned this
from the Geneva Report

1153
00:55:10,512 --> 00:55:11,470
and the other readings.

1154
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:13,900
But what are the
costs and challenges?

1155
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:16,840
Well, of course, we still
have a bunch of scalability

1156
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:17,950
and performance issues.

1157
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:21,040
We have the privacy
issues and coordination.

1158
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:23,620
I'm not trying to hold us
all to that, by the way,

1159
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:26,560
for your final projects.

1160
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:29,380
If we're not going to get to
scalability for five or seven

1161
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:32,120
years, I'm not
going to say, well,

1162
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,600
then you all have to write
about permissioned systems.

1163
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:35,290
No.

1164
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:41,080
I'm OK if you say,
well, this is a pilot

1165
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,610
and somebody else
is going to solve

1166
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:47,020
through layer two or
zk-SNARKs or something,

1167
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:49,730
these other things.

1168
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:52,390
But I'd like you to
at least identify

1169
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:54,620
what are the issues
of scalability,

1170
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:57,910
performance, privacy, security,
those issues that might

1171
00:55:57,910 --> 00:56:00,650
hold your implementation out.

1172
00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:02,470
Can a permissioned
blockchain adequately

1173
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:06,000
addresses whatever
the use case is?

1174
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,910
And how can you actually
jump start broad adoption?

1175
00:56:09,910 --> 00:56:12,820
That's your network challenges.

1176
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:15,340
How, when you start Uber,
can you get a lot of people

1177
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:16,750
to use your Uber app?

1178
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:21,280
But in this case, if I can
use that consumer credit--

1179
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:25,270
I thought the consumer credit
idea was really a neat one.

1180
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:28,060
Maybe it could go right at the
heart of a lot of market power.

1181
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:30,525
But now, how do you get
all the auto dealers,

1182
00:56:30,525 --> 00:56:31,900
how do you get
all the employers,

1183
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:35,410
how do you get the
banks to actually say,

1184
00:56:35,410 --> 00:56:40,990
I want to get rid of First
Union and I want the Blockchain

1185
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:45,170
and Money final project team's--

1186
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:48,920
and by the way, just replacing
one central monopolist

1187
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,770
with another central monopolist,
a lot of commercial banks

1188
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:54,367
aren't terribly
excited about that.

1189
00:56:54,367 --> 00:56:56,450
Maybe you're going to have
to give some ownership.

1190
00:56:56,450 --> 00:56:58,700
Maybe you'll have to give
50% of your ownership

1191
00:56:58,700 --> 00:57:02,940
to the 20 banks that
are now a part of this.

1192
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:04,940
There are other ways to
build incentive systems.

1193
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:07,700
Maybe you put a
native token in there

1194
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:11,150
and you give them
the native token.

1195
00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:13,520
So there may be
other incentive ways

1196
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:16,730
to beat the current monopolist.

1197
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,250
But having been around
commercial banks

1198
00:57:22,250 --> 00:57:29,042
for a long time, they
really are looking for ways

1199
00:57:29,042 --> 00:57:32,400
to replace their aggregators
and their back office,

1200
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:37,250
whether it's clearing,
settlement, exchanges, credit

1201
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:38,580
agencies.

1202
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:41,000
But they are deeply
understanding--

1203
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,630
because they are pretty
ambitious and very

1204
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:46,970
good at making money
as well, they deeply

1205
00:57:46,970 --> 00:57:50,330
understand that every idea
that's pitched to them

1206
00:57:50,330 --> 00:57:53,660
is somebody who
currently is small

1207
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:57,920
but wants to get big
and gain market power.

1208
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,350
So they're also always
thinking about how

1209
00:58:00,350 --> 00:58:04,610
to ensure that there's
a check to slow down

1210
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:08,040
your startup from gaining
market power 5, 10,

1211
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:09,080
and 15 years from now.

1212
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:11,810
They don't want you to be
the next Clearinghouse,

1213
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:15,740
like the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange or Intercontinental

1214
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:16,250
Exchange.

1215
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:20,960
They don't want you to be the
next central node of market

1216
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,070
power.

1217
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:23,840
So you might share
some of that with them,

1218
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:27,370
or you might find
an incentive system.

1219
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:29,450
And then what are the net?

1220
00:58:29,450 --> 00:58:34,130
So key questions for companies
designing blockchains.

1221
00:58:34,130 --> 00:58:38,090
This is something from MIT's
own Sloan Management Review.

1222
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:39,950
It was not a required
reading, but I

1223
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:42,290
thought it was a nice
little way to do it.

1224
00:58:42,290 --> 00:58:43,442
What are you trying to do?

1225
00:58:43,442 --> 00:58:44,900
Are you trying to
record something?

1226
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:45,567
Track something?

1227
00:58:45,567 --> 00:58:46,430
Verify something?

1228
00:58:46,430 --> 00:58:47,390
Aggregate something?

1229
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:51,050
This was in the Fall MIT Review.

1230
00:58:51,050 --> 00:58:53,070
What value do you
want to capture?

1231
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:55,070
Literally, here's a
list of the things

1232
00:58:55,070 --> 00:58:56,970
you might want to capture.

1233
00:58:56,970 --> 00:58:58,310
Is it about contracts?

1234
00:58:58,310 --> 00:58:59,870
Is it about permissioned?

1235
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:04,850
What is the value we're trying
to capture and for whom?

1236
00:59:04,850 --> 00:59:08,100
Obviously, is it for suppliers
or customers and so forth?

1237
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:11,750
So it's another slice by
thoughtful people, MIT.

1238
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:18,410
That's a link to the reading
if you do want to read it.

1239
00:59:18,410 --> 00:59:22,540
It was a well-written
five page article.

1240
00:59:22,540 --> 00:59:26,180
I even held back on one reading.

1241
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:30,973
So the benefits of blockchain--
we reviewed this last Tuesday,

1242
00:59:30,973 --> 00:59:32,640
so I'm not going to
go through it again.

1243
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,970
But again, as you're
thinking about this

1244
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:37,090
and thinking about which
use cases and so forth,

1245
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:39,250
think of these costs
of verification.

1246
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:42,440
Which of these are you
really trying to hit?

1247
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:43,610
Or is it networking?

1248
00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:46,190
And I changed the
networking a little bit,

1249
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:51,580
but a token incentive system,
which could be like the skins,

1250
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:53,770
rewards, and affinity,
identity could help

1251
00:59:53,770 --> 00:59:56,680
you start it up or operate it.

1252
00:59:56,680 --> 01:00:00,250
Or it could be
like CryptoKitties,

1253
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:02,710
where it's like a collectible.

1254
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:04,600
So that's another
way that you have

1255
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:06,250
token economics floating in.

1256
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:11,210
So this you've seen.

1257
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:14,860
I've flipped it
around, but basically,

1258
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:17,600
do you use a
traditional database?

1259
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,790
Do you think about a
private blockchain?

1260
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:22,280
Do you think about
a public blockchain?

1261
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:24,980
If you're over here, I really
ask you, Brodish, you've

1262
01:00:24,980 --> 01:00:26,490
got to get to yes.

1263
01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:29,933
You've got to get to here.

1264
01:00:29,933 --> 01:00:31,600
You wouldn't want me
to just be teaching

1265
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:34,390
a traditional database, how do
you build something in Sloan,

1266
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:35,110
right?

1267
01:00:35,110 --> 01:00:36,910
This is blockchained money.

1268
01:00:36,910 --> 01:00:41,230
Or as Alin wants me to relabel
it, append-only logs, consensus

1269
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:42,971
protocols, and money.

1270
01:00:42,971 --> 01:00:43,893
[LAUGHTER]

1271
01:00:43,893 --> 01:00:45,280
AUDIENCE: And a native currency.

1272
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:46,240
GARY GENSLER: And
a native currency.

1273
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,010
But how many of
you would sign up?

1274
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:49,615
Would you recommend
that I list it

1275
01:00:49,615 --> 01:00:52,982
in the course catalog that
way for next September?

1276
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:54,220
AUDIENCE: No.

1277
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:55,540
GARY GENSLER: Really?

1278
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:57,310
No, not really.

1279
01:00:57,310 --> 01:00:58,000
All right.

1280
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:03,640
But if you want to really
juice, get to here.

1281
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:06,280
Put an append-only log
in there and some even

1282
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:09,610
private permissioned system.

1283
01:01:09,610 --> 01:01:11,800
Or be bold.

1284
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,720
Try to get all the way to there.

1285
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:17,150
Don't stay there, please.

1286
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:17,650
All right.

1287
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:18,460
I've made my point.

1288
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:19,917
James.

1289
01:01:19,917 --> 01:01:20,500
Where are you?

1290
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:22,110
Are you there or there?

1291
01:01:22,110 --> 01:01:24,491
AUDIENCE: I think I'm in the
middle, private blockchain.

1292
01:01:24,491 --> 01:01:25,574
GARY GENSLER: Ah, come on.

1293
01:01:25,574 --> 01:01:26,970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1294
01:01:26,970 --> 01:01:27,970
GARY GENSLER: All right.

1295
01:01:27,970 --> 01:01:30,810
Good.

1296
01:01:30,810 --> 01:01:35,030
Yeah, but they're going
to get at least to there.

1297
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:38,222
They're not staying there,
they want to get a good grade.

1298
01:01:38,222 --> 01:01:40,530
[LAUGHTER]

1299
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:41,260
No, no.

1300
01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:42,670
Really, this is going to be fun.

1301
01:01:42,670 --> 01:01:44,020
Listen, I get it.

1302
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:46,273
It's not just like any
Sloan class, where you

1303
01:01:46,273 --> 01:01:47,440
have a final and everything.

1304
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,000
I've given you a hard test.

1305
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:52,850
There's $30 billion chasing
around to try to find uses.

1306
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:56,680
There's thousands-- 2,500 at IBM
or whatever-- there's thousands

1307
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:57,880
of people trying to do this.

1308
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:02,500
And there's no really true
market-wide applications

1309
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:04,330
right now.

1310
01:02:04,330 --> 01:02:09,100
But that's the nature of what
we're doing here together.

1311
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:11,080
And I'm not asking
that somebody actually

1312
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:13,720
be able to go raise money
and actually start it.

1313
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:17,350
You don't have to code
it, except for you, Alin.

1314
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:19,670
But you don't have to
actually code this thing.

1315
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:24,340
But I'm really looking
for your business savvy,

1316
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:28,150
and it's more about
critical reasoning skills.

1317
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:32,530
And these four or five
pages, pull it off of Canvas

1318
01:02:32,530 --> 01:02:34,960
and think about it,
think about how it fits

1319
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:38,500
in with your projects or not.

1320
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:40,440
Yes?

1321
01:02:40,440 --> 01:02:43,570
AUDIENCE: Given that-- well,
the question in previous slides

1322
01:02:43,570 --> 01:02:44,590
are helpful.

1323
01:02:44,590 --> 01:02:48,820
But I still find it's hard to
decide whether we should really

1324
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:52,900
use blockchain
database [INAUDIBLE]

1325
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:54,310
traditional database.

1326
01:02:54,310 --> 01:02:58,820
So is there a non-technical
model or framework that we can

1327
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:03,040
[INAUDIBLE] between those two?

1328
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:06,100
GARY GENSLER: I think of it--

1329
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:10,720
I apologize if to go back to
the slides, so I'll try not to.

1330
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:15,470
But I think about it
as, are you moving

1331
01:03:15,470 --> 01:03:18,760
around something of value?

1332
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,590
Do you need multiple
people to be

1333
01:03:20,590 --> 01:03:25,020
able to help in that network?

1334
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:26,160
Because it's peer to peer.

1335
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,350
If it were the 80 or
90 of us in this room,

1336
01:03:28,350 --> 01:03:30,540
you might be just
there right now,

1337
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:32,850
that there's a benefit
of that peer to peer

1338
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:35,100
movement of something of value.

1339
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:40,500
Or frankly, even back
to this, if there's

1340
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:41,760
a lot of economic rents.

1341
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,910
If there's market power
in this, if there's

1342
01:03:44,910 --> 01:03:50,650
big market power and somebody
is just collecting lots,

1343
01:03:50,650 --> 01:03:53,710
that might be your opportunity
because this is the technology

1344
01:03:53,710 --> 01:03:55,780
that can get you there.

1345
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:58,990
And you might say,
well, I don't absolutely

1346
01:03:58,990 --> 01:04:02,950
have to have an append-only
consensus native currency

1347
01:04:02,950 --> 01:04:07,680
type of technology, but it's
how I get to peer to peer.

1348
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:09,200
So it might be
that that's the way

1349
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,660
that I'm going to
disrupt the party

1350
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:13,640
with the big economic rents.

1351
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:16,580
Like the letter to
Jamie Dimon, if there's

1352
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:18,628
a bunch of things
about censorship risk.

1353
01:04:18,628 --> 01:04:21,170
And again, I don't know what
use cases you're thinking about.

1354
01:04:21,170 --> 01:04:23,770
But I think if
you don't have one

1355
01:04:23,770 --> 01:04:27,910
of these six, the
verification costs,

1356
01:04:27,910 --> 01:04:32,290
it's unlikely you need an
append-only log and consensus

1357
01:04:32,290 --> 01:04:34,030
in the whole mechanism.

1358
01:04:34,030 --> 01:04:37,630
But I think if you do have
something here, hopefully not

1359
01:04:37,630 --> 01:04:40,760
just economic rents
but market power,

1360
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:43,930
this might be the way you
get underneath it, by having

1361
01:04:43,930 --> 01:04:47,410
a decentralized peer
to peer approach.

1362
01:04:47,410 --> 01:04:49,090
So if that helps.

1363
01:04:49,090 --> 01:04:53,500
And it could be something that
has no central authority right

1364
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:56,140
now, no central intermediary,
and it's just how

1365
01:04:56,140 --> 01:04:57,910
to jump start something.

1366
01:04:57,910 --> 01:04:59,440
I think in that
circumstance, it's

1367
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:02,320
more likely you
need a native token.

1368
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:06,370
I think if you're trying
to jump start a network--

1369
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:08,970
and there's a lot of
collective action reasons

1370
01:05:08,970 --> 01:05:10,470
that will still face you.

1371
01:05:10,470 --> 01:05:12,630
Some of our colleagues,
Andy Lippman

1372
01:05:12,630 --> 01:05:15,780
and others over at the Media
Lab, spent a lot of time

1373
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:18,420
a year, year and a half ago
on a medical records approach

1374
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:22,017
with Beth Israel
Hospital locally here.

1375
01:05:22,017 --> 01:05:23,850
And if Andy were here,
he'd say, but I still

1376
01:05:23,850 --> 01:05:25,830
have the collective
action issues.

1377
01:05:25,830 --> 01:05:27,330
How do I get a
bunch of hospitals

1378
01:05:27,330 --> 01:05:29,250
and a bunch of
doctors and how do I

1379
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:33,000
get all that collective
action to work together

1380
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,780
to use one database
system, if you wish?

1381
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:39,090
So I think to get over that
collective action issue,

1382
01:05:39,090 --> 01:05:41,340
you start getting into,
well, this native token

1383
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:43,596
might be an interesting
way to do that.

1384
01:05:43,596 --> 01:05:44,820
AUDIENCE: Right.

1385
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:48,720
It seemed that Uber satisfied
the things you just mentioned.

1386
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:49,720
GARY GENSLER: They did.

1387
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:49,990
They did.

1388
01:05:49,990 --> 01:05:51,300
But would they have
done it differently

1389
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:52,950
if they started in
a different era?

1390
01:05:56,250 --> 01:05:58,550
I don't know.

1391
01:05:58,550 --> 01:06:01,370
It's remarkable that they
took on and just completely

1392
01:06:01,370 --> 01:06:05,830
transformed the ride
share business, the taxi

1393
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:08,890
business, if you wish.

1394
01:06:08,890 --> 01:06:11,278
But I'm pretty
confident of this,

1395
01:06:11,278 --> 01:06:12,820
there will be
something that we don't

1396
01:06:12,820 --> 01:06:17,530
envision right now that really
transforms the next thing.

1397
01:06:17,530 --> 01:06:19,682
As my brother said
when he said, it

1398
01:06:19,682 --> 01:06:21,140
might be five and
10 years from now

1399
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:22,930
and you won't even expect it.

1400
01:06:22,930 --> 01:06:26,570
Who would have thought
the internet in the 1990s

1401
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:30,720
was going to go straight and
transform the taxi business?

1402
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:32,490
Nobody in the New
York Taxi business

1403
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:36,020
would have envisioned that,
which was one of the things

1404
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:39,850
that he mentioned.

1405
01:06:39,850 --> 01:06:43,360
So why use blockchain
versus traditional database?

1406
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:44,560
We did that.

1407
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:46,600
I know, you got it got, Brodish?

1408
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:47,730
Right there?

1409
01:06:47,730 --> 01:06:48,230
OK.

1410
01:06:48,230 --> 01:06:50,900
No, I'm having some fun.

1411
01:06:50,900 --> 01:06:54,850
So the trade-offs we've talked
about, so these are costs.

1412
01:06:54,850 --> 01:06:56,740
This is the cost
of centralization

1413
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:58,750
versus decentralization.

1414
01:06:58,750 --> 01:07:00,340
We've looked at
this slide before.

1415
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:05,520
I think this was an
earlier question.

1416
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,590
Over time, I think
what's going to happen

1417
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:11,610
is these graphs might
have different slopes.

1418
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:15,180
So it's just like, OK,
what if the slopes change?

1419
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:18,600
I think that the cost
of decentralization

1420
01:07:18,600 --> 01:07:21,270
are going to come down.

1421
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:27,990
But that's more my
forecasting prognostication.

1422
01:07:27,990 --> 01:07:30,720
And then you'll have
more applications

1423
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:33,660
that feel more comfortable
over using something

1424
01:07:33,660 --> 01:07:35,340
around this space.

1425
01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:38,060
Now, I could be wrong and
it could go the other way.

1426
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:39,200
Just saying.

1427
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,550
And this would be more of
the minimalist side and says,

1428
01:07:41,550 --> 01:07:44,487
well, you can address some
of those centralization costs

1429
01:07:44,487 --> 01:07:45,820
and it comes down the other way.

1430
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:48,000
So it's just a
visual way to think

1431
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,468
about what will happen
over time with innovation.

1432
01:07:51,468 --> 01:07:53,010
But I think innovation
will pull down

1433
01:07:53,010 --> 01:08:02,300
the slope towards that from
where we are today because

1434
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:04,670
of the newer technology,
this decentralized

1435
01:08:04,670 --> 01:08:08,070
how can we do this.

1436
01:08:08,070 --> 01:08:11,850
And I think there will be
more opportunities around it.

1437
01:08:11,850 --> 01:08:12,350
All right.

1438
01:08:12,350 --> 01:08:16,130
So on the 30th, we're
going to be talking

1439
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:20,620
about basically our first area.

1440
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:22,092
We're going to talk
about payments.

1441
01:08:22,092 --> 01:08:23,800
We're going to talk
a lot about payments.

1442
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:26,380
I'm going to take two days
to talk about payments.

1443
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:29,710
So we're going to lay
out a lot about what's

1444
01:08:29,710 --> 01:08:33,700
going on in finance outside of
append-only logs and consensus

1445
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:36,840
protocols and blockchain.

1446
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:40,029
But we're going to have
fun because what we all

1447
01:08:40,029 --> 01:08:40,810
live together.

1448
01:08:40,810 --> 01:08:42,852
And some of you actually
live in these countries.

1449
01:08:42,852 --> 01:08:47,290
But whether it's Alipay,
[INAUDIBLE],, and M-Pesa, so

1450
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:49,810
all these initiatives.

1451
01:08:49,810 --> 01:08:55,120
And then how could maybe
blockchain fit into it?

1452
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:59,020
In terms of the use cases,
these are all those use cases

1453
01:08:59,020 --> 01:09:05,290
that we're going to be doing
from October 30 to December 6.

1454
01:09:05,290 --> 01:09:08,560
But this gives you a sense,
what I call Act Three.

1455
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:10,359
And we're going to
really be trying

1456
01:09:10,359 --> 01:09:14,300
to challenge each other about--

1457
01:09:14,300 --> 01:09:17,420
some weeks, I'm going
to give you a heads up,

1458
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:19,040
it's going to be a little thin.

1459
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:20,630
I'm going to be
looking for who's

1460
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:22,008
got really good use cases.

1461
01:09:22,008 --> 01:09:24,050
If you have something to
bring into the classroom

1462
01:09:24,050 --> 01:09:26,510
that you're saying,
hey, this reading

1463
01:09:26,510 --> 01:09:29,120
list I put together
in late August--

1464
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:31,250
and by November, it
might be that there's

1465
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:34,729
somebody that's actually
moved something further.

1466
01:09:34,729 --> 01:09:35,899
So don't be bashful.

1467
01:09:35,899 --> 01:09:38,060
Shoot it into me in time
and I'll distribute it

1468
01:09:38,060 --> 01:09:39,740
to the whole class.

1469
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:44,479
But in a couple of places,
digital ID, for instance,

1470
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:46,970
I thought it was thin.

1471
01:09:46,970 --> 01:09:50,600
There's the Estonia case,
but it's not really--

1472
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,310
not sure it's a blockchain.

1473
01:09:56,630 --> 01:09:58,280
I'm admitting in
advance, some of these

1474
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:02,810
are a little thin
but still good.

1475
01:10:02,810 --> 01:10:05,330
And the readings for the 30th--

1476
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:07,040
the Federal Reserve
Payment Study really

1477
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:08,510
shows a bunch of information.

1478
01:10:08,510 --> 01:10:11,893
And you have to read the words,
just look at the few charts.

1479
01:10:11,893 --> 01:10:13,310
But it's going to
give you trends.

1480
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:17,180
You're going to really see some
interesting trends in there.

1481
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:20,450
What the best mobile apps are,
and the global payment report,

1482
01:10:20,450 --> 01:10:22,640
and things like that.

1483
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:26,450
Any questions on any of that?

1484
01:10:26,450 --> 01:10:28,220
And then what did we talk about?

1485
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:30,710
Blockchain technology
can address costs

1486
01:10:30,710 --> 01:10:33,980
through verification
and networking.

1487
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:38,730
The potential use cases--
the devil is in the detail.

1488
01:10:38,730 --> 01:10:41,510
It's true in most
things in life,

1489
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:44,930
but it really is these
natty little details

1490
01:10:44,930 --> 01:10:46,760
about what transactions,
who am I going

1491
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:50,900
to try to disintermediate, where
am I going to create value,

1492
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:55,100
why use a permissioned
or permissionless

1493
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:58,060
blockchain rather than
a traditional database,

1494
01:10:58,060 --> 01:11:02,750
and really get some value.

1495
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:06,380
I think you really have
to address this question,

1496
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:08,600
but I think there's
potential there.

1497
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:11,660
Or why a public blockchain
versus a private?

1498
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:15,110
Is a token going to help
you jump start something?

1499
01:11:15,110 --> 01:11:17,290
And remember, there's two
different types of tokens.

1500
01:11:17,290 --> 01:11:20,070
There's the broad
currency type token.

1501
01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:22,900
That might be Bitcoin, and they
might have won the whole thing,

1502
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:25,873
or it'll be somebody else, or
there might be two or three.

1503
01:11:25,873 --> 01:11:28,165
I personally don't think
there'll be hundreds of those.

1504
01:11:30,670 --> 01:11:32,790
But then there might
be, in essence,

1505
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:37,000
use case-specific tokens.

1506
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,550
Right now we have 1,600,
and most will fail.

1507
01:11:44,450 --> 01:11:45,540
So that's it.

1508
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:49,274
Any other queries or anything?

1509
01:11:49,274 --> 01:11:50,650
Yeah?

1510
01:11:50,650 --> 01:11:56,930
AUDIENCE: Once all the bitcoins
are mined in 2040 or 2030--

1511
01:11:56,930 --> 01:11:59,310
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

1512
01:11:59,310 --> 01:12:00,880
AUDIENCE: 2040.

1513
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:05,280
GARY GENSLER: But by 2040, it's
a very slow inflation curve.

1514
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:06,890
It's probably a
slow inflation curve

1515
01:12:06,890 --> 01:12:08,810
in the middle of the 2030s.

1516
01:12:08,810 --> 01:12:10,430
AUDIENCE: The
incentives, if there

1517
01:12:10,430 --> 01:12:14,240
will continue to be
incentives for node operators

1518
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:17,540
to continue operating
benevolently, if there's

1519
01:12:17,540 --> 01:12:18,530
no further incentives--

1520
01:12:18,530 --> 01:12:24,020
GARY GENSLER: So the question
is, what happens in 20--

1521
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:29,300
when there's very
few mining rewards?

1522
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:30,590
And the answer is--

1523
01:12:30,590 --> 01:12:31,730
I'm going to have some
fun with you here.

1524
01:12:31,730 --> 01:12:33,313
I'm going to show
you one other thing.

1525
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:40,340
The answer is, yes,
because it's fees.

1526
01:12:42,990 --> 01:12:45,860
And the fees in the system--

1527
01:12:49,878 --> 01:12:51,070
I apologize.

1528
01:12:51,070 --> 01:12:54,640
It's just one thing that I
want to show you that's fun.

1529
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:55,900
The fees in the system--

1530
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:08,680
so right now you can have
fees, if you remember how

1531
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:11,290
there are fees in the system.

1532
01:13:11,290 --> 01:13:15,280
And instead of having
mining rewards,

1533
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:17,890
right now there are
very small fees.

1534
01:13:17,890 --> 01:13:20,500
So for every transaction
you put into Bitcoin,

1535
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:24,190
you can actually say,
instead of taking at exactly

1536
01:13:24,190 --> 01:13:25,890
that the inputs
equal the outputs,

1537
01:13:25,890 --> 01:13:30,910
you have inputs greater than the
outputs, and the net is fees.

1538
01:13:30,910 --> 01:13:45,640
And what is the case
there is that in 2030

1539
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:48,010
or something like
that, I think the fees

1540
01:13:48,010 --> 01:13:50,770
will continue to increase,
I think, if this takes off.

1541
01:13:50,770 --> 01:13:53,500
The question is,
does it take off?

1542
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:56,470
So I just had some fun because
this day is an important day

1543
01:13:56,470 --> 01:14:00,070
for me since you met him.

1544
01:14:00,070 --> 01:14:04,616
So whom is whom?

1545
01:14:04,616 --> 01:14:07,352
[LAUGHTER]

1546
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:11,390
I sent this picture
to Rob this morning

1547
01:14:11,390 --> 01:14:14,237
because today is our birthday.

1548
01:14:14,237 --> 01:14:17,111
[CHEERING, APPLAUSE]

1549
01:14:18,798 --> 01:14:20,590
AUDIENCE: (SINGING)
Happy birthday to you--

1550
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:21,850
GARY GENSLER: No, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

1551
01:14:21,850 --> 01:14:22,784
That's all right.

1552
01:14:22,784 --> 01:14:25,840
AUDIENCE: (SINGING)
Happy birthday to you.

1553
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:27,500
GARY GENSLER: No, no, no, no.

1554
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:31,000
AUDIENCE: (SINGING) Happy
birthday, dear Gary.

1555
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:35,594
Happy birthday to you.

1556
01:14:35,594 --> 01:14:37,482
[APPLAUSE]

1557
01:14:38,335 --> 01:14:40,806
GARY GENSLER: So who's who?

1558
01:14:40,806 --> 01:14:42,590
AUDIENCE: You're in the white.

1559
01:14:42,590 --> 01:14:46,430
GARY GENSLER: White in
striped shirt or not?

1560
01:14:46,430 --> 01:14:47,213
OK.

1561
01:14:47,213 --> 01:14:48,575
AUDIENCE: Solid.

1562
01:14:48,575 --> 01:14:49,565
AUDIENCE: Your stripes.

1563
01:14:49,565 --> 01:14:50,565
GARY GENSLER: All right.

1564
01:14:50,565 --> 01:14:54,040
How many striped shirters?

1565
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:54,730
All right.

1566
01:14:54,730 --> 01:14:55,230
All right.

1567
01:14:55,230 --> 01:14:57,820
How many solid shirters?

1568
01:14:57,820 --> 01:14:58,930
Wow.

1569
01:14:58,930 --> 01:15:01,180
So I sent it to
Rob this morning,

1570
01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:02,680
and I sent it to
my three daughters,

1571
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:03,972
and I sent it to my girlfriend.

1572
01:15:03,972 --> 01:15:06,130
I said, who is this?

1573
01:15:06,130 --> 01:15:07,640
It's split view there, too.

1574
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:09,490
[LAUGHTER]

1575
01:15:09,490 --> 01:15:13,970
I went with striped shirt,
but Rob said he doesn't know.

1576
01:15:13,970 --> 01:15:15,850
[LAUGHTER]

1577
01:15:17,260 --> 01:15:18,640
We were three years old there.

1578
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:26,120
So that's just a
goof around with you.

1579
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:26,620
All right.

1580
01:15:26,620 --> 01:15:28,620
Thank you all.
