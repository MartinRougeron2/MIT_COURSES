8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,570
GARY GENSLER: Thank you
for everybody coming back.

9
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:32,150
And I should tell
you, when I start

10
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:35,030
the session with
that little shh,

11
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:40,420
I learned from a
congressman in Baltimore.

12
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:44,270
As some of you know, I've spent
a lot of time around politics.

13
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:46,610
And one of my roles
in politics was

14
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:50,060
that I was the treasurer of
the Maryland Democratic Party.

15
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:51,800
Which, if you
anybody ever asks you

16
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,810
to be the treasurer of
a state party, come.

17
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:57,080
I can give you some
advice about what

18
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,910
that's all about
when your home state

19
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:00,510
senator asks you to do it.

20
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:05,420
So I had to quiet down the
annual Jefferson Jackson Day

21
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:06,890
dinners.

22
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:10,070
I'd organize these big dinners,
and there's 400, 500, 600

23
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,630
people at these dinners.

24
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:12,450
I couldn't do it.

25
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,955
I couldn't get their attention.

26
00:01:13,955 --> 00:01:16,338
And Congressman Elijah
Cummings comes up,

27
00:01:16,338 --> 00:01:17,630
and he just leans into the mic.

28
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:19,290
Shh.

29
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,170
And it quieted the
whole place down.

30
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:23,530
I said, Congressman,
what is this?

31
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,580
Is this something you've
learned in politics,

32
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:32,060
something you learned from
your minister, your priest?

33
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,730
He said, it works every
time, works every time.

34
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:39,110
So Elijah Cummings gave
me that little duty.

35
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,510
Blockchain and
money, we're here.

36
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,490
I know it's a little
bit like eating broccoli

37
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:46,040
these last couple of
classes, because we went

38
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,610
through cryptography, and
then we moved a little bit

39
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:54,320
into consensus protocols.

40
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,460
And today, we're going to pick
that up and try to finish up

41
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:02,150
the design bits of Bitcoin.

42
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:06,263
I wanted to introduce,
though, one walk-in.

43
00:02:06,263 --> 00:02:08,180
We're going to have
walk-ins from time to time

44
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:08,763
in this class.

45
00:02:08,763 --> 00:02:11,690
But Patrick Murck,
he's hiding over here

46
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:13,550
with the cap in the hoodie.

47
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,190
He's got the look
for a lawyer who's

48
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:20,270
been spending his time around
Bitcoin for seven years.

49
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:23,732
Now, he's currently affiliated
with Berkman Klein at Harvard.

50
00:02:23,732 --> 00:02:25,690
And I didn't know Patrick
was going to be here,

51
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:26,648
so I'm calling him out.

52
00:02:26,648 --> 00:02:28,910
He's also special counsel
of the Cooley law firm.

53
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,880
And he has a bunch
of clients who

54
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,620
try to do the right
thing by the law.

55
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,535
But sometimes they
find themselves

56
00:02:36,535 --> 00:02:38,660
dealing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission

57
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,580
or other fine
government institutions.

58
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,890
But Patrick was
also general counsel

59
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,323
to the Bitcoin Foundation.

60
00:02:45,323 --> 00:02:47,240
And for a short while,
you ran it, didn't you,

61
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,358
before it kind of went puff?

62
00:02:50,358 --> 00:02:51,150
PATRICK MURCK: Yes.

63
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,718
[INAUDIBLE]

64
00:02:52,718 --> 00:02:53,510
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

65
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,700
But Patrick's the type
of lawyer that wears

66
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,500
a hoodie and a baseball cap.

67
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,440
He's a Bitcoin lawyer.

68
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,860
If you ever need Patrick for
one of your entrepreneurial

69
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,970
efforts, I'm sure Cooley law
firm will like advising you,

70
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,626
too.

71
00:03:09,626 --> 00:03:11,087
AUDIENCE: Do you take bitcoin?

72
00:03:11,087 --> 00:03:12,170
GARY GENSLER: What's that?

73
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:13,890
AUDIENCE: Does he take bitcoin?

74
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,350
PATRICK MURCK: I have.

75
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:22,000
[INAUDIBLE] In fact, I've
never bought a bitcoin, ever.

76
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,030
[INAUDIBLE] paid 100% in
bitcoin, so it's all good.

77
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,593
[LAUGHTER]

78
00:03:26,593 --> 00:03:28,010
GARY GENSLER: So
Patrick, when you

79
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:32,660
get paid 100% in
bitcoin from a client,

80
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,630
how long do you hold it?

81
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:38,938
PATRICK MURCK: Well,
it depends, right?

82
00:03:38,938 --> 00:03:40,922
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

83
00:03:40,922 --> 00:03:42,680
PATRICK MURCK: Often,
in the early days--

84
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,960
not very long,
because I had to pay

85
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,183
for my mortgage and my kid's
daycare and things like that,

86
00:03:48,183 --> 00:03:49,350
and they don't take bitcoin.

87
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:53,180
So I've sold a lot of
bitcoin over the years.

88
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,385
Something sadly, but
I never bought them.

89
00:03:56,385 --> 00:03:57,265
I just earned them.

90
00:03:57,265 --> 00:03:59,390
GARY GENSLER: Earned them--
so you're like a miner,

91
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,370
except for you're a
lawyer who gets bitcoin.

92
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:01,870
[LAUGHTER]

93
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,328
PATRICK MURCK: I
mine with my mind.

94
00:04:03,328 --> 00:04:05,490
[LAUGHTER]

95
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,580
GARY GENSLER: The study
questions for today

96
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,740
was, we were going to
turn to that last piece

97
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:17,779
about transactions and something
called the unspent transaction

98
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:23,540
output, and script code that
is a computer code that's

99
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:26,968
used inside of Bitcoin.

100
00:04:26,968 --> 00:04:29,900
We're going to talk a
little bit about the design

101
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,360
features bringing it all
together, and particularly

102
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,230
around the reading, which
was the academic pedigree

103
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,240
of Bitcoin.

104
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,130
Which is also a
reading that Patrick

105
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:46,310
assigns when he does his study
group at Harvard Law, as well.

106
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,690
And then, yes, all
of you are going

107
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:49,990
to be able to participate.

108
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,540
And we're going to take a
survey amongst all of you

109
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,210
as to who's Satoshi Nakamoto.

110
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,540
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

111
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,220
Or would you rather do more
on transactions script?

112
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,930
[LAUGHTER]

113
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:06,240
All right, we'll do
a little bit of both.

114
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,015
The readings, of course, the
Bitcoin Academic Pedigree,

115
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:12,140
which we're going to talk
about in the latter part.

116
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,120
And I'll do a
little cold-calling

117
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,870
and get some feedback as to what
you thought from the reading

118
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,930
or if you're still skimming it.

119
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,750
And then there was a
CoinDesk article, just

120
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:26,870
making sense of it all.

121
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:31,840
And so as I said, we'll go
through the transactions.

122
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,350
We'll do a little bit of
putting it all together

123
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,160
and the Academic Pedigree.

124
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,710
We'll have a little fun.

125
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:40,800
You all are going
to have a chance

126
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,610
to tell us who Satoshi Nakamoto
is, or was, or the committee.

127
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:50,760
So transactions-- you've
seen this graph before.

128
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,750
But transactions, the
format in a transaction

129
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,780
ledger-- not only in Bitcoin,
but really everything--

130
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,420
is somebody on one
side of a transaction

131
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,910
and somebody on another
side of a transaction.

132
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:07,370
So in Bitcoin, there's an input.

133
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:15,690
And the input inside of Bitcoin
is an ID of a previous output.

134
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:21,450
So not only is Bitcoin a series
of blocks of information--

135
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:27,860
each block that has 1,000 to
2,000 individual transactions--

136
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,760
but in a sense, there's a
separate chain that's going on.

137
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,500
I sometimes think
of a blockchain

138
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:38,700
as, yes, there's the chain
of big chunks of data,

139
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,660
but there's also a chain
of individual transactions.

140
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,852
Shimon, is that a hand raised
or just scratching your head?

141
00:06:44,852 --> 00:06:46,148
AUDIENCE: I'll be more careful.

142
00:06:46,148 --> 00:06:47,606
GARY GENSLER: No,
that's all right.

143
00:06:47,606 --> 00:06:50,257
Shimon is a faculty member
of the Finance department

144
00:06:50,257 --> 00:06:50,840
here at Sloan.

145
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,545
And some of you might take his
Finance 1 course, I assume.

146
00:06:55,545 --> 00:06:56,795
Somebody in here is, probably.

147
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,570
So the input is
just really the idea

148
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,780
of wherever the output was.

149
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:09,590
You can think of a
chain of a transaction.

150
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:13,080
Can anybody tell me where
all transactions come from?

151
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,420
Where's sort of the genesis
of the value, if you

152
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:22,450
follow a transaction
chain back to its origin?

153
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,498
Hugo.

154
00:07:23,498 --> 00:07:24,290
AUDIENCE: Coinbase.

155
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,510
GARY GENSLER:
Coinbase-- so anybody

156
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:30,305
want to say what a Coinbase is?

157
00:07:30,305 --> 00:07:36,140
AUDIENCE: It's a generation
of a freshly minted bitcoin.

158
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,730
GARY GENSLER: Right,
so the generation

159
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:40,580
of a freshly minted bitcoin--
not the way that Patrick Murck

160
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:44,360
got it when he's selling
his services for the law,

161
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,010
but how a miner gets it,
they get their transactions.

162
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,850
Remember initially, 50 coins
was what happened initially back

163
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,350
in 2009.

164
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,670
Now it's 12 and 1/2 coins.

165
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,760
And in a short couple--

166
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,470
maybe it's about
18 or 20 months,

167
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,450
it goes to 6 and 1/4 coins.

168
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:07,370
And it keeps splitting half
and half and half, eventually

169
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,010
to no Coinbase.

170
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,410
But every transaction,
in essence,

171
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,420
had to go back all
the way to Coinbase--

172
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:20,270
some Coinbase, some 50 or 25 or
12 and 1/2 coins being issued.

173
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,290
And then the output--

174
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:24,560
so a transaction format
is pretty straightforward,

175
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,190
in a sense.

176
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:30,590
The input is a previous output
and a digital signature,

177
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:33,200
and then, to whom do
you want to send it.

178
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,510
And it's sent to
Bitcoin addresses.

179
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,309
That's why we spent
just a moment--

180
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:40,429
we just glossed over what
a Bitcoin address is.

181
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:43,880
It's sort of a translation
to a public key,

182
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,910
but it's not identical
to a public key.

183
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,950
And of course, you need value.

184
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,470
Value measured in
bitcoins or satoshis,

185
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,270
or if we're on the
Ethereum network,

186
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:56,750
it would be an ether and
gas, et cetera, et cetera.

187
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:58,760
On 1,600 different
platforms, it could

188
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,005
be a different native currency.

189
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,085
Lock time, I don't
think lock time

190
00:09:06,085 --> 00:09:07,210
was in any of the readings.

191
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,910
But anybody want to tell
me what a lock time is?

192
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:14,600
It's relevant to some of
how the technology goes.

193
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,090
Anybody want to take a guess?

194
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,020
Where's Alin?

195
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,170
Not Alin the PhD, but Alin
from the digital currency

196
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:21,680
initiative.

197
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,130
No?

198
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:22,713
You're hiding.

199
00:09:22,713 --> 00:09:24,780
You don't want to say
what a lock time is?

200
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:29,640
AUDIENCE: I thought it's some
sort of protection mechanism

201
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:34,212
for, I guess, double spending.

202
00:09:34,212 --> 00:09:36,710
GARY GENSLER: It is a protection
mechanism, but not so much

203
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,260
about double spending.

204
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,647
Tom, did I see your hand up?

205
00:09:39,647 --> 00:09:40,730
AUDIENCE: This is a guess.

206
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:44,080
Is it when the
transaction is hashed?

207
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,080
GARY GENSLER: It's when.

208
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,310
It's about time.

209
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:48,570
It's when the
transaction can happen.

210
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:51,620
So right now, it's
2:45 on September 20.

211
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:56,510
If you put a lock time
in at 2:50 or 2:55,

212
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:59,210
it couldn't happen until 2:55.

213
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:01,790
So you can actually
conditional the transaction.

214
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,470
That's all lock time is.

215
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,790
But you can say, it
can't happen until.

216
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,528
You could put tomorrow's date.

217
00:10:08,528 --> 00:10:10,070
AUDIENCE: The
counterparty sets that,

218
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,468
so it's like the
date on a check?

219
00:10:11,468 --> 00:10:13,510
GARY GENSLER: It's a little
different than a date

220
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,980
on a check.

221
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,940
Because one of the things
that gets validated in Bitcoin

222
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:23,310
is, is that it will not
validate a transaction early.

223
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:28,330
And if you put October 6
on a handwritten check,

224
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,760
the bank might still take
it, even though they probably

225
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,530
shouldn't.

226
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:35,880
So it is like the
date on a check,

227
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:42,020
except it's verified and
validated and so forth.

228
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:45,110
I'm going to take
Emily and then Shimon.

229
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:47,610
AUDIENCE: So if you were to set
the lock time in the future,

230
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:53,100
could that mess up the
blocks in the chain?

231
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,850
What is kind of the
right chain of events

232
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:59,430
that you're recognizing
if you're choosing to set

233
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,953
a lock time in the future?

234
00:11:00,953 --> 00:11:03,120
I guess the broader question
would be, why would you

235
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,643
set a lock time in the future?

236
00:11:05,643 --> 00:11:07,560
GARY GENSLER: Shimon,
were you answering that?

237
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,990
AUDIENCE: No, no, no.

238
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,282
I want to ask you, in the
[INAUDIBLE] question section,

239
00:11:11,282 --> 00:11:15,030
is what purpose does
it serve, right?

240
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,310
AUDIENCE: It's not a really
Turing complete language,

241
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:21,390
so you're not really trying
to create conditions here.

242
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,943
But this is sort of a condition.

243
00:11:22,943 --> 00:11:24,360
GARY GENSLER: So
it's a condition.

244
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,010
Because at any
point in time, you

245
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,600
might want a
condition of payment.

246
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,780
You might want a condition
of payment on time.

247
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,540
And we're, in a
few slides, going

248
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,360
to talk about the scripting
language, the computer

249
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,520
language that allows
transactions to happen.

250
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:43,270
Shimon said, was
not Turing complete.

251
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:47,980
From the readings,
anybody want to tell us

252
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:52,720
what Turing complete is in
computer science language?

253
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,190
No?

254
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,660
Anybody know who Turing is?

255
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,787
Anybody see Imitation Games.

256
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,855
Anyone know what
the Turing Award is?

257
00:12:05,855 --> 00:12:09,130
It's sort of the Nobel Laureate
for computer scientists.

258
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:11,780
AUDIENCE: Isn't that the
award when the machine can

259
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,720
actually can pass
as a human being?

260
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,220
GARY GENSLER: Well, that's one
thing associated with Turing.

261
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,270
But the Turing Award
is an annual award,

262
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:23,540
sort of like a Nobel Laureate,
but for computer scientists.

263
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,470
Turing complete allows
you to do loops inside

264
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:30,120
of computer programs.

265
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,540
And the script language does
not allow that to happen.

266
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:37,800
Every function needs to
sort of have some language.

267
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,410
I know Alin looking at
me to see I don't dive.

268
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:47,340
But to answer Emily's
question, it's just,

269
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:50,760
there's so many different ways
to condition a transaction.

270
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,410
And Satoshi Nakamoto
thought, well,

271
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:56,490
let's put it in here, right
in the transaction format,

272
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:00,100
that you can condition on time.

273
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,470
And then two parties
could do that.

274
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:05,560
To your question about
whether it could inadvertently

275
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,840
lead to double spending,
it's a very good question.

276
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,960
Can I hold it until we just
do validation for a second?

277
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,650
So this is a unique
identifier for the input.

278
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:23,140
But it's really uniquely
identifying from a past output.

279
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,030
What's the block number?

280
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:30,130
Is it from the 250,000th
block or the 300,000th block?

281
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:33,250
So it takes
literally a block ID.

282
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,610
And then within that block,
which one of its 1,500

283
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:39,100
transactions might it be?

284
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:43,060
So you can find any transaction
on an entire blockchain

285
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:46,330
by knowing the block, and
then within the block, which

286
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,620
transaction.

287
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:52,210
It's just a data mechanism
on how to store data.

288
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,710
And through this
mechanism, there's

289
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:58,230
a chain of transactions, as
well as a chain of blocks.

290
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:01,478
And then the value we
talked about that--

291
00:14:01,478 --> 00:14:03,270
I think there's, if I
did my numbers right,

292
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:07,213
10 to the 8th satoshis
in every bitcoin.

293
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:08,630
It's a little hard
because I think

294
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,020
there's 10 to the ninth
gas in every ether.

295
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,340
And that's a coin.

296
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:17,290
That is what is a coin.

297
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,480
When Satoshi Nakamoto did
this, it wasn't really

298
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,670
a coin, because it was a
question whether anybody

299
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,890
would give value.

300
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:25,240
And until about 18
months later, when

301
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,920
those two pizzas went for
10,000 bitcoin, what was it?

302
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,590
Or until somebody started
the first exchange,

303
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:41,230
a crypto exchange,
to exchange that.

304
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:45,040
So you can also have multiple
inputs and multiple outputs.

305
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,610
And I'm going to use an
example that I just created of,

306
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:52,000
I want to send some bitcoins
to two different people.

307
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,240
And I need some bitcoins.

308
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,310
So I might grab
three former inputs.

309
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:02,570
And these are just
Transaction ID 6, Index 3.

310
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:04,240
Of course, it wouldn't be ID 6.

311
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,410
It might be ID 300,000.

312
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:11,290
But the point being
is, grab 10 bitcoin,

313
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:15,140
so I want to find three inputs.

314
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:20,650
And I needed to send six
bitcoins, let's say, to Amanda.

315
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:21,560
You like that.

316
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,690
And just because you're
sitting up front, James,

317
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,220
I'm just going to send three.

318
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,250
But I'm not using Amanda's
name and James' name.

319
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,150
I'm using your Bitcoin address--

320
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:35,270
Amanda's Bitcoin address,
and James' Bitcoin address.

321
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,690
So rather than
being account-based,

322
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:42,430
like if you have an account at
Bank of America, and you say,

323
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:46,120
I want to send $10,
I just check to make

324
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,070
sure I have more than $10.

325
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:52,270
In Bitcoin, I actually have
to fine individual transaction

326
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:55,090
outputs that add up
to-- in this case,

327
00:15:55,090 --> 00:16:00,790
I want to send nine bitcoin,
six to Amanda, three to James.

328
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:04,000
Not really, Amanda.

329
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,145
So what's 10 minus 9?

330
00:16:06,145 --> 00:16:06,990
AUDIENCE: 1.

331
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:07,990
GARY GENSLER: Thank you.

332
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:09,610
That was really hard.

333
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:11,800
We are at MIT.

334
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,680
But I might not
send one back to me.

335
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,920
I'm going to send
0.9 back to me.

336
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,180
This is kind of my change.

337
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,900
So a Bitcoin transaction
can either be equal,

338
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,050
the inputs equal the outputs.

339
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:30,750
I could have sent
one back to me.

340
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:34,290
But I've decided to
incentivize miners and leave

341
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:39,860
a little extra, 0.1 bitcoin,
which would be a lot of fee,

342
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,670
actually.

343
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:45,403
That would be about,
what, $640 or so?

344
00:16:45,403 --> 00:16:46,570
I probably wouldn't do that.

345
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:54,030
I would probably leave for a fee
10 or 20 or 100 satoshi maybe.

346
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:57,170
I don't know what the
current market is.

347
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,360
But this is a transaction.

348
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,360
Multiple inputs, multiple
outputs, but you always

349
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:06,220
have to send back to yourself.

350
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:09,010
What happens to these inputs
if this transaction actually

351
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,990
happens?

352
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,420
They go away.

353
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:18,810
The actual inputs disappear
once they go through this.

354
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:21,680
And so inputs always
have to equal outputs.

355
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:26,480
When a transaction is validated,
one of the validation methods

356
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,935
is to make sure that the lock
time has actually happened,

357
00:17:29,935 --> 00:17:31,310
that you've passed
the lock time.

358
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:35,210
Another validation point is
that inputs are greater than

359
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,350
or equal to outputs.

360
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,300
If outputs are
greater than inputs,

361
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:42,020
the transaction will
not be validated.

362
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,680
The digital signatures
have to be validated,

363
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,710
going just back to
the prior slide.

364
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:54,170
That digital signature has
to be validated, as well.

365
00:17:54,170 --> 00:18:00,040
And that, this previous ID
and index actually exists.

366
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:03,050
And this is getting to
your question Emily.

367
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:05,940
It still exists.

368
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,160
But these inputs,
once you've used them,

369
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,590
they no longer exist
in the database.

370
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:16,150
They're kind of in the past.

371
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,950
So that's the transactions.

372
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:18,730
That's the core.

373
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,010
I know it's like
eating broccoli,

374
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:25,590
but it's an important part of
all of blockchain technology.

375
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:28,280
The Coinbase transaction
we've already talked about,

376
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,740
so I'll slide over this quickly.

377
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:32,590
But it's a reward for
solving the puzzle.

378
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:35,170
In the case of Bitcoin, it's
solving the proof of work.

379
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:35,670
Tom.

380
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:39,287
AUDIENCE: Sorry, can we go
back to the miner incentive.

381
00:18:39,287 --> 00:18:43,830
It's the 0.1 or 1 satoshis.

382
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:46,510
And how is that different
than the cost of trust

383
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:50,590
when you use a financial
institution as the [INAUDIBLE]??

384
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:56,360
GARY GENSLER: So Tom's question
is, the miners' economics.

385
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,880
Of course, they get
their 12 and 1/2 bitcoin,

386
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,420
and they might get
some transaction fees.

387
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,130
Tom's question's the other side.

388
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:07,130
Why is that any
different than paying

389
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:08,750
some central intermediary?

390
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:15,060
Anybody want to try doing this?

391
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,880
I could cold-call, but
does anybody want to--

392
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,410
this is an economics
question about markets.

393
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,570
AUDIENCE: I would say
that the person that

394
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:27,720
is sending the transaction
has the ability

395
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,800
to choose how much it will
pay for that transaction.

396
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:37,860
And in the bank, it's
regulated, and you pay.

397
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,360
Maybe that's one
of the differences.

398
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,110
GARY GENSLER: All
right, so one difference

399
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:46,680
is that the bank is setting,
generally, a fixed fee

400
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:51,180
schedule, and this is
a decentralized market

401
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,880
mechanism for setting fees.

402
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,525
Sean.

403
00:19:54,525 --> 00:19:58,080
AUDIENCE: The fee for
intermediaries a lot higher

404
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,320
compared to Bitcoin,
the transaction fees.

405
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,820
GARY GENSLER: So
Sean's second point

406
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,790
is that, currently-- this might
not be true in the future.

407
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:08,430
But currently,
central intermediaries

408
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:12,510
are able to charge higher fees
than in this decentralized

409
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,476
system.

410
00:20:13,476 --> 00:20:14,390
Alin?

411
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,140
AUDIENCE: I think that,
conceptually, it's

412
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:20,180
not different from a
centralized intermediary.

413
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,590
It's just, the
functions are the same.

414
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:25,140
The amounts, maybe
the amount that I pay,

415
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,030
the amount of the
fees are different,

416
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,972
but the concepts are the same.

417
00:20:28,972 --> 00:20:31,180
GARY GENSLER: All right, so
Alin is basically saying,

418
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,597
well, maybe it's
not so different.

419
00:20:32,597 --> 00:20:35,820
I mean, though it might be
floating rather than fixed,

420
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,437
it might be currently
lower rather than higher,

421
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:40,020
but you're saying,
fundamentally, it's

422
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,610
about the same.

423
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,610
One minute, Shimon,
let me just--

424
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,030
because you're faculty.

425
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:47,090
You're going to actually
tell us the answer.

426
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:50,060
AUDIENCE: Question--
is this mandatory?

427
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,310
GARY GENSLER: Very good
question-- it's not mandatory.

428
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:57,210
AUDIENCE: So that could create
a big misalignment of interest.

429
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:58,710
GARY GENSLER: So
it's not mandatory.

430
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:01,620
Fees are market-based.

431
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,750
And at times, like
last December,

432
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,850
they were really high.

433
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:09,030
And now they're
quite low, partly

434
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:14,670
because the Bitcoin network is
not humming at full capacity.

435
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:19,110
It can readily fit 1,000 to
2,000 transactions a block.

436
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:21,270
And it's not like
there's a jamming

437
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:24,870
to get 10,000 and 20,000
transactions into a block,

438
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:27,120
as there was last December.

439
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,351
I'm sorry, Shimon.

440
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,420
AUDIENCE: I think
it's very different,

441
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,880
in the sense that
you're basically

442
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,180
inflating the fee in most
[INAUDIBLE] inflation.

443
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:41,430
So even if when
you don't transact,

444
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:44,460
you're paying implicitly for
other people's transactions,

445
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:46,230
and that's going to
change over time.

446
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:49,110
So that's actually kind
of a clever mechanism

447
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:52,690
of how, structurally,
these are going

448
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:55,410
to shift over time
in the network,

449
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,720
as it hopefully matures.

450
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,650
GARY GENSLER: Why don't
we take one more here--

451
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:01,960
Alexis.

452
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:08,070
AUDIENCE: That's like when
you have [INAUDIBLE] they're

453
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,420
going to keep the money.

454
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:14,400
And they could use it for
making [INAUDIBLE] or whatever.

455
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,210
So they make money on a spread.

456
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,990
Whereas here, for
the case of Bitcoin,

457
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,847
the money's going to
stay in the system,

458
00:22:20,847 --> 00:22:22,680
and it's going to flow
to another miner, who

459
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,850
is going to use it for
another transaction.

460
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:28,530
It will stay within the
same network, I would say,

461
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:31,088
rather than just going
to another destination.

462
00:22:31,088 --> 00:22:32,130
GARY GENSLER: I hear you.

463
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:34,800
But it might actually leave
the network to lawyers,

464
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,430
like Patrick.

465
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:40,040
Or it might leave the network
if you use it at Starbucks,

466
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,660
if Starbucks would accept it.

467
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:47,420
So I'm challenging
your thought, but you

468
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,620
can challenge mine back.

469
00:22:52,355 --> 00:22:57,610
Why don't we close out with
Eric, and then just move on.

470
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:00,370
AUDIENCE: The difference
might be in the perspective.

471
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:04,140
From the person that's
originated a transaction,

472
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,770
it's basically the same thing.

473
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:09,400
But if you think
about it as a system,

474
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,720
there's no single entity
gathering all the money

475
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,560
from transactions.

476
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,230
You have a network, a
[INAUDIBLE] network,

477
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:21,140
of [INAUDIBLE] that
are getting that.

478
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:25,240
And besides, once we get
out past the 21 million

479
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:30,497
bitcoin generation cap,
then all the systems

480
00:23:30,497 --> 00:23:32,080
must be using
[INAUDIBLE] in some way.

481
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,260
And transaction fees
would be [INAUDIBLE]..

482
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:40,510
GARY GENSLER: So Eric raises
two points that I'll--

483
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,910
there are other points, but
two that I want to repeat.

484
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:47,380
One is, this is more
decentralized possibly today

485
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:51,670
than the current commercial
banking system, for instance,

486
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:55,900
for transaction processing,
or the transaction processing

487
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,650
that Visa and First
Data do, which we'll

488
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:03,010
study when we get to payments.

489
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:05,028
So it's possibly
more decentralized.

490
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:06,820
I think you said it
was more decentralized,

491
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,710
but I'm putting the
word possibly in there.

492
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:16,030
And two is that, at
least in bitcoin's case,

493
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:20,350
there's two revenue sources
for providing the services.

494
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:23,480
The miners do it for the
Coinbase transactions, 12

495
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,880
and 1/2 bitcoin per block,
approximately $80,000 US

496
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,530
per block currently.

497
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:32,110
But also, there's
this little incentive

498
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:39,580
of fees, which, over time, will
have to grow as you go down.

499
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:43,300
If it's only going to be
one bitcoin per transaction,

500
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:47,950
and then ultimately almost
0 bitcoin for transaction,

501
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:50,980
there will have to be more
satoshis in the fee side.

502
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,200
And some alternative coins--

503
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,650
not Bitcoin-- are
more modeled on fees,

504
00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:03,610
and some coins are more
modeled on mining rewards.

505
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:06,850
The economics--
Satoshi Nakamoto,

506
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:11,410
whomever he or she was,
or were, if it's a group,

507
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:14,610
had to think through
a bunch of economics.

508
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,050
They've survived for 10 years.

509
00:25:16,050 --> 00:25:18,810
It doesn't mean that's the
best set of microeconomics

510
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:21,420
for a blockchain system.

511
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,770
Tom, you look really skeptical.

512
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:23,993
AUDIENCE: I'm skeptical.

513
00:25:23,993 --> 00:25:25,410
But maybe this
would be the moment

514
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:27,045
where I take my 12-hour dive.

515
00:25:27,045 --> 00:25:28,170
GARY GENSLER: That's right.

516
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:31,720
So you're about ready
for your rabbit dive?

517
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,220
Maybe.

518
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:32,887
AUDIENCE: Maybe.

519
00:25:35,432 --> 00:25:37,140
GARY GENSLER: So the
Coinbase transaction

520
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,940
we've talked a lot about.

521
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:44,220
The reward, at least in Bitcoin,
halves every 210,000 blocks.

522
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,740
A very important thing
that Nakamoto put in

523
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:51,430
is, you couldn't use your
Coinbase reward for 100 blocks.

524
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:57,420
So it was sort of stale
or frozen for 100 blocks.

525
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,660
I can think of two
reasons, but maybe you all

526
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:03,060
would think of another reason.

527
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:06,280
Anybody want to give it a shot
as to why you might do it?

528
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,950
Xiaojian

529
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,480
AUDIENCE: Maybe
you mine the block,

530
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,980
and you're trying to mine
a block that shouldn't be--

531
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,520
or it's not legal.

532
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,210
You spend the money right
away so you can get--

533
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:18,960
GARY GENSLER: This is
the principal reason

534
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,240
that's talked about, not
only in the literature,

535
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:26,660
but in the early blog post,
was, well, how many blocks does

536
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:29,370
the chain have to go
before everybody really

537
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:31,590
thinks it's consensus?

538
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,830
You could have said 5, 10, 20.

539
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:37,650
Satoshi picked 100
blocks, saying,

540
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:42,160
that, hopefully,
is pretty settled,

541
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,930
or about 1,000 minutes.

542
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:46,430
James.

543
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:48,500
AUDIENCE: If you mine,
and then you can spend,

544
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,690
couldn't you just
perpetually create blocks

545
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:53,270
and then pay yourself and
create more and earn more

546
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:55,085
and then keep building
up [INAUDIBLE]??

547
00:26:55,085 --> 00:26:56,460
GARY GENSLER: So
James is asking,

548
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,130
could you just kind
of game the system

549
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:00,695
and keep mining and spending
and mining and spending?

550
00:27:03,485 --> 00:27:05,125
AUDIENCE: Then your
rewards go down.

551
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:06,250
GARY GENSLER: Sorry, Aviva?

552
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,933
AUDIENCE: Then your
awards go down over time.

553
00:27:08,933 --> 00:27:10,850
GARY GENSLER: Well, that
takes 200,000 blocks.

554
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:12,980
AUDIENCE: But if there
are many of you doing that

555
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:16,330
at the same time, then
you accelerate the--

556
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:18,830
GARY GENSLER: So in some ways,
that's what miners are doing.

557
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:21,770
But they have to
wait 100 blocks.

558
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:25,100
And so that was what Satoshi
was trying to get at.

559
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:30,000
If you have to wait 100 blocks,
it's probably now the consensus

560
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,170
chain.

561
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:34,740
It's probably been so
validated, unless we

562
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,080
got into the problem--

563
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,200
Patrick, you weren't here.

564
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,140
But some of the students
raised the question, well,

565
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,930
what if one country
as large as China

566
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:46,910
walled off their whole
network, and just China

567
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:51,470
went one way and the rest
of the world went another?

568
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:54,230
The theory of the case is
that, within 100 blocks

569
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:58,080
or 1,000 minutes, somehow
that would be discovered.

570
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,270
But if it weren't, you might
have a little bit of what

571
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:05,430
James is raising as a question.

572
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:08,330
But that's at least
the theory of the case.

573
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:14,140
It's always recorded as the
first transaction in the Merkle

574
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:14,980
Tree.

575
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,170
Highly technical
point, but it has

576
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:19,810
to roll up into that darn
thing we were talking about,

577
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:23,640
the data compression
at the Merkle Tree.

578
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,980
And here's a little fun fact.

579
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:31,340
You can add 100 bytes of
arbitrary data in a Coinbase.

580
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:34,850
You might say, why
does he raise this?

581
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:37,460
Well, because it's
just a fun little place

582
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:43,310
that some people express their
creative wit, artistic stuff,

583
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:46,020
send secret messages
to each other,

584
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:49,920
that, buried in the
Coinbase transactions,

585
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:53,120
there is a whole forensics
of fun little things

586
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,240
that sometimes miners
put in to the Coinbase,

587
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,800
for those of you
who are artistic.

588
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:05,580
The very first genesis
block had this sentence.

589
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:09,990
"The Times, January 3,
2009, Chancellor on brink

590
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:11,790
of second bailout for banks."

591
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,920
That was a headline out
of the Financial Times

592
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:18,906
that says Satoshi Nakamoto put
in the first block of Coinbase.

593
00:29:18,906 --> 00:29:21,400
It's just a little fun place.

594
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,370
There's a playfulness that goes
on amongst miners, sometimes

595
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:25,660
talking to each other.

596
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:26,830
Did you ever get a message?

597
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,190
Did anybody send you--

598
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,800
PATRICK MURCK: Not
that I'm aware of.

599
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,175
I know what you're
talking about.

600
00:29:31,175 --> 00:29:33,820
There's one miner that likes
to put Catholic catechisms in.

601
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:36,220
GARY GENSLER: That has put
in the whole catechism?

602
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:37,540
PATRICK MURCK: In every block,
there's a little catechism

603
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,720
that he puts in.

604
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,880
It's a Allegis mining pool.

605
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,160
It's a small one.

606
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,040
So there you go.

607
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,250
GARY GENSLER: There you go.

608
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,930
And do they pay you
in bitcoin, too?

609
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:49,670
PATRICK MURCK: No,
they're not a client.

610
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:52,360
GARY GENSLER: OK.

611
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,230
So it all rolls into a database
called the unspent transaction

612
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:57,050
output.

613
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:59,020
These are the
unspent transactions.

614
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,840
If it's been spent,
it's kind of burned.

615
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,650
And bitcoin transactions
that haven't been spent

616
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:08,740
fall into this.

617
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:11,110
And you can use it.

618
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,840
It's created because it
speeds up the whole system.

619
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,930
Instead of going back and
looking for all these things,

620
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:18,430
there's actually a
database that has

621
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:21,220
all the unspent transactions.

622
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,770
I include in here
what I find as a sort

623
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:27,670
of interesting
revelation or irony.

624
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:33,570
When Satoshi built Bitcoin,
and for the 16 versions

625
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:35,790
that have come since
over the 10 years,

626
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:39,060
all the developers, the
Bitcoin core developers,

627
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,790
have kept the unspent
transaction output,

628
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:46,080
not on a blockchain
specifically, but in a database

629
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,750
called a LevelDB database.

630
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:51,900
So those of you who are closer
to computer science than I

631
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,860
could say all the pros and
cons of a LevelDB database.

632
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:57,990
But I'm just
observing that, even

633
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:06,040
within the most used first
central database for blockchain

634
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:10,210
called Bitcoin, they chose
to use not a blockchain,

635
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:13,900
but, in essence, a more
standard database to keep

636
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:17,260
the unspent transaction output.

637
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:20,940
Now, in a sense, it's all part
of this blockchain solution.

638
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:24,130
I'm just saying,
it's one database

639
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:26,230
within the blockchain
world that's

640
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:28,333
actually not a blockchain.

641
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,550
It's just sort of an
interesting irony.

642
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:36,370
But it also sort of
says, economically

643
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:39,700
and technologically,
Satoshi was trying

644
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,020
to create a money system.

645
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,580
He wasn't trying
to use blockchain

646
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:45,680
for every bit of data.

647
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,865
So this is the actual size of
the unspent transaction output.

648
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:49,990
If you can't see, there's--

649
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:53,830
I think it's about
50 to 60 million.

650
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,610
It was higher.

651
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:57,880
There was about 60
million unspent.

652
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,250
It's not 60 million
bitcoins, because there's

653
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,770
about 17 million bitcoin.

654
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:04,310
So you could average it out.

655
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:06,190
You could say, well,
each transaction

656
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,380
has less than 1 bitcoin.

657
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,990
Well actually, there's been
surveys and studies showing

658
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:14,470
that about half of these
54 million transactions are

659
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:18,990
so small that they go by the
term of-- they're called dust.

660
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:22,360
That there's so few
satoshi that it's not

661
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:26,130
even worth the fees
to try to redeem them.

662
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:29,040
They only add up to less
than a half a percent

663
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:34,230
of all the outstanding
bitcoin, but they're just dust.

664
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:39,000
So maybe out of these 54 million
unspent transaction outputs,

665
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,060
half of them will never
be used, because it's not

666
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,800
economically worthwhile.

667
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,800
It's like the pennies in
the top dresser drawer

668
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:50,560
that you all might not spend.

669
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:53,700
There's this similar thing here.

670
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,330
Hugo.

671
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:56,755
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I guess I
have a question about that.

672
00:32:56,755 --> 00:32:58,380
It might not be
feasible now, but maybe

673
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:01,320
with layers on top of
bitcoin that people can

674
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,220
do these micro-transactions.

675
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,730
Because like, our pennies
might be worth a lot

676
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:06,997
of money, [INAUDIBLE].

677
00:33:06,997 --> 00:33:08,580
GARY GENSLER: So
Hugo is raising that,

678
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,620
just like the pennies in
your top dresser drawer

679
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,840
might be worth
something one day,

680
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:16,200
what I'm referencing as
Bitcoin dust, about half

681
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,250
of these unspent transaction
outputs, a satoshi here,

682
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:23,910
10 satoshi there, might
one day be worth something.

683
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,170
Good point.

684
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,960
It's just like the pennies in
your top dresser drawer though.

685
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,500
Have you lost them
in the meantime?

686
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,750
They might be worth something.

687
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:34,170
But in the meantime, have
you lost the private key

688
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:37,530
to those little satoshis?

689
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:39,570
I put on here three
moments of time

690
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:41,940
just to give you the
sense of the actual number

691
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,950
of transactions
that have happened.

692
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:47,550
There's been 342 million
transactions on the Bitcoin

693
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:50,340
network to date, or
as of a day or two ago

694
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:53,210
when I put the slides together.

695
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:55,760
So of the 340
million transactions,

696
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,390
only about 54 million
are still outstanding.

697
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:05,760
The other 290 million have
been spent, if you wish.

698
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,300
Yes.

699
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,129
AUDIENCE: So then where are
these outstanding transactions

700
00:34:12,129 --> 00:34:12,629
stored?

701
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:18,895
Are they still being included
in the blocks themselves,

702
00:34:18,895 --> 00:34:20,520
where you add them
to the [INAUDIBLE]??

703
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,020
GARY GENSLER: Which outstanding
transactions, the 54 million

704
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,870
that are still available?

705
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:32,420
The 54 million all reside in
a database within the Bitcoin

706
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:37,429
software called the unspent
transaction output, UTXO.

707
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:41,540
And UTXO-- these aren't
letters I'm making up--

708
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:46,600
that's a database, 54
million transactions.

709
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:50,830
Separately, they are actually
in the blockchain itself.

710
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:54,940
So all 340 million transactions
that have ever happened

711
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:57,300
are in the blockchain.

712
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:01,680
But to make it easier for
the software, the 54 million

713
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:08,220
that have never been spent
reside in a software.

714
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,710
Does that answer the question?

715
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:11,300
Work with me.

716
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,967
AUDIENCE: So it's a
distributed database

717
00:35:12,967 --> 00:35:14,550
amongst all the different nodes.

718
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:15,467
GARY GENSLER: Correct.

719
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:22,200
All 10,000 of the nodes
can have the full UTXO set.

720
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,530
Some wallet providers
have the full UTXO set,

721
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:27,740
but they don't have to.

722
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:33,043
Somewhat lightweight nodes
usually don't, but can.

723
00:35:33,043 --> 00:35:34,460
But a lightweight
node would never

724
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:37,550
want to have all 340 million
and the full blockchain.

725
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:41,300
So in essence, they're
in multiple places,

726
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:46,650
because they're in the full
blockchain, 10,000 nodes.

727
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:50,120
And they're also in the UTXO,
not only on the 10,000 nodes,

728
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,770
but occasionally elsewhere.

729
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:53,450
Alin.

730
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:56,810
AUDIENCE: So I heard you say
the word spent transaction,

731
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:58,610
which is a bit misleading.

732
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:00,900
Because a transaction can
be spent and not spent.

733
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,440
Because, for example, you
would have two outputs.

734
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,990
One output is spent by
a future transaction,

735
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:08,070
and the other
output is not spent.

736
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:10,222
So it's a bit misleading
to say spent transaction,

737
00:36:10,222 --> 00:36:12,680
because that only happens when
the transaction has only one

738
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,480
output and that output is spent.

739
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,730
GARY GENSLER: Well,
I'm using it lightly.

740
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:20,570
I'm saying that, of the 340
million transactions that

741
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:23,105
have happened, 290--

742
00:36:23,105 --> 00:36:24,730
AUDIENCE: Have an
output that is spent,

743
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:27,210
or what are you saying exactly?

744
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:29,310
Because transactions
have multiple outputs.

745
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:32,150
They might have n, and
maybe k of them are spent.

746
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:33,930
So the other
outputs are unspent.

747
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:36,300
GARY GENSLER: I'm saying
there's 340 million--

748
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:40,440
if I did my data search
correctly-- and I'm fallible,

749
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,340
so I might not have.

750
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,100
But if I did my data
source correctly,

751
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,490
there was 340 million
previous outputs.

752
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:49,990
290 million of them are gone.

753
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:52,770
AUDIENCE: OK, so then you
should say transaction outputs,

754
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:55,200
because those are different
than transactions.

755
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:55,950
GARY GENSLER: Yes.

756
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:59,040
Except for it was
easier to put TXS.

757
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:03,243
But yes, Alin's clarification
is, I believe, accurate.

758
00:37:03,243 --> 00:37:05,160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
so people can understand

759
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,260
that there is a difference
between a transaction

760
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,430
and a transaction output.

761
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,710
GARY GENSLER: In essence,
what Alin's saying is,

762
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:15,180
there's currently 54
million transaction outputs

763
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:19,360
in the UTXO, which
also says outputs.

764
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:23,320
There had been, in the past,
another 290 million outputs

765
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:27,435
that have already been spent.

766
00:37:27,435 --> 00:37:28,750
Are we together?

767
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,200
So there's a scripting language.

768
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,650
There's a little bit
of computer code.

769
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:38,960
I said there was no prerequisite
to take any computer

770
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,880
science before you were here.

771
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,130
And my own computer
programming is so old,

772
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:47,780
because when I was programming,
it was in Fortran and APL.

773
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,950
And you can look that up.

774
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:52,100
It's kind of like
around with cuneiform

775
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:57,350
and you know the Rosetta Stone.

776
00:37:57,350 --> 00:38:02,990
But Satoshi Nakamoto
decided to put a little bit

777
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:06,650
of computer programming inside.

778
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:08,390
And I'm not going to
get the count right,

779
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:11,030
but there's several hundred,
but not several thousand,

780
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:13,130
little operations
and codes that you

781
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:17,390
can use in the Bitcoin script.

782
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:19,940
It's not Turing
complete, which means

783
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:23,840
you can't do a lot of the
things that you can do in all

784
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,730
the rest of computer science.

785
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:29,340
But it's more secure.

786
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,980
In essence, it has
fewer attack vectors.

787
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:36,300
It's harder to bring
down a little bit.

788
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,570
It's a programming
code, as I said.

789
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:42,090
For those interested,
it's called stack-based,

790
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:46,260
where you sort of move the
code over one at a time

791
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:49,320
as it's being performed.

792
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,940
And it gives some flexibility.

793
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:53,940
And back to Emily's question
about why there was lock time,

794
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:59,700
or Shimon's, scripting code
allows for some conditionality,

795
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:03,240
that it appears that
Nakamoto was trying

796
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:06,270
to give some
ability to condition

797
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:14,070
a transaction on events, but
not so much conditionality, so

798
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:17,550
much flexibility, that he
needed a Turing complete.

799
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:20,550
So he kind of, I'm going to
say, chose a midway place.

800
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:26,430
I believe, you could
have created Bitcoin

801
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,980
and say there was no
scripting language.

802
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:34,750
It was just going to be a
straight instruction, moving

803
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,940
this input to another output.

804
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:42,100
Created a little bit of
computer code, but not a lot.

805
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,970
That's what I think of the
economics and the marketplace

806
00:39:45,970 --> 00:39:46,900
for this.

807
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:50,930
And next Tuesday when we
talk about smart contracts--

808
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,140
and I promise you,
there's a reason

809
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,390
for the craziness of
my talking about Turing

810
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:57,640
complete and scripting code.

811
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:01,180
Because next Tuesday, we'll be
talking about smart contracts

812
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,910
where they're much
more flexible.

813
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:06,712
And so this is sort
of the foundational--

814
00:40:06,712 --> 00:40:08,170
and you don't need
to know anything

815
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:10,660
more about computer
science than you want,

816
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,910
unless you go with Tom
down that rabbit hole

817
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,590
and spend more time reading.

818
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:22,180
So there's four different types
of, I call them script types.

819
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:25,300
They're not actual script
words, but you will read

820
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,080
about these from time to time.

821
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,390
And I just wanted
to cover these four.

822
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:32,650
The UTXO, remember, is about
54 million transactions.

823
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:34,480
And there's been a
nice academic paper

824
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,020
that I didn't assign that
was written earlier this year

825
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:41,770
that investigated
the whole 54 million,

826
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:44,470
all of the unspent transactions.

827
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:45,820
And this is how it broke down.

828
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:53,050
81% are transactions that send
to a hash of a Bitcoin address.

829
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:56,930
Eight, nine years ago
when Satoshi created this,

830
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:59,210
that was not the most
popular instruction.

831
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:00,860
But it's basically
sending an output

832
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:05,120
to the hash, the compression,
the commitment of a Bitcoin

833
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,050
address.

834
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:09,210
We're now up to 18%.

835
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:12,240
This didn't exist three
and four years ago, really.

836
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:16,080
But 18% go to a
conditional script.

837
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,420
It's a hash of a
conditional script.

838
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,840
So somebody saying, Emily,
it's not even about time.

839
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:25,200
It's like, you can
only get it when

840
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,810
all these other instructions
that are in the scripting

841
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:30,650
language happen.

842
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:33,790
And I'm going to hide the
conditions in a hash of it.

843
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:43,720
And then only 0.1% goes
the way that he first

844
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:47,330
envisioned nine years ago,
directly to a Bitcoin address.

845
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:49,840
So it's either to a hash
of a Bitcoin address,

846
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:53,320
a hash of a conditional script,
and a little less than 1% now

847
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,900
go to multiple signatures.

848
00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:00,150
Meaning, you need two out of
three or three out of five.

849
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:03,880
Or believe it or not,
this academic paper

850
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:06,730
shows that some say 0 out of 1.

851
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:09,790
Now, it's hard to believe that
somebody mistakenly programmed

852
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:14,020
something to go to 0 signatures,
but apparently somebody did.

853
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:16,210
So I just wanted to
give you a sense there's

854
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:21,310
some flexibility in the computer
code, not a lot of flexibility,

855
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:26,560
but just enough that you can do
things that are really helpful.

856
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,730
And they're going to solve a
lot of challenges for Bitcoin.

857
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:32,410
Hugo mentioned layer 2.

858
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:35,470
We're going to be talking about
layer 2 later in the semester,

859
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:39,340
where there's a whole way to put
technology on top of Bitcoin.

860
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,350
And it's because the
scripting language is there

861
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,400
that you can do that.

862
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,690
Any questions on script?

863
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:50,830
I know I'm trying to cover
a big, weighty topic in 120

864
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:51,635
seconds or less.

865
00:42:55,648 --> 00:42:56,148
No?

866
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:01,090
So just back to the whole--

867
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:02,020
this is just a review.

868
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:04,030
What have we've talked about?

869
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:06,610
There's that little
graphic again.

870
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:08,830
It's just a bunch of blocks.

871
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:10,870
That's what a blockchain is.

872
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:13,960
Though today, we realize
that underneath the blocks,

873
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,170
we have another chain.

874
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:17,740
I often think of two chains--

875
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:20,020
the chains of blocks.

876
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:24,590
In Bitcoin, there's about
a half a million blocks.

877
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:27,080
But underneath that, there's
all the transactions that

878
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,970
are, in fact, chained, as well.

879
00:43:28,970 --> 00:43:32,720
54 million of those outputs
have not yet been spent

880
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:37,280
and 290 million outputs
have been spent.

881
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,190
But underneath about a
half a million blocks,

882
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:47,840
there's been 340 million
outputs, so to speak.

883
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,680
It creates a database.

884
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:53,220
Bitcoin is a
transaction database.

885
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:56,700
Next Tuesday, we'll talk about
an account-based database

886
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,140
in Ethereum.

887
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:00,390
But it could be a ledger
which is transactions

888
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:03,420
or a ledger which is balances.

889
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:06,810
Satoshi Nakamoto decided
to do transactions here.

890
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:10,410
In some ways, I believe it's
because it was fewer attack

891
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:12,330
vectors.

892
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:14,030
Probably a little
bit more secure,

893
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:16,320
but I'm not entirely sure.

894
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:21,180
And until you solve the riddle
as to who Satoshi Nakamoto is,

895
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:23,940
we won't know the answer.

896
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:24,440
Of

897
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:27,410
Course, hash functions
we talked about,

898
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:30,890
and digital signatures,
and a consensus protocol.

899
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:35,660
So I like to think of
it in three buckets,

900
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:38,060
whether it's for a
dinner party conversation

901
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:40,700
or digging into three lectures.

902
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,740
It's the cryptography itself.

903
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:45,288
We did that last Thursday.

904
00:44:45,288 --> 00:44:46,830
And if you have to
remember anything,

905
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:49,110
it's only two
cryptographic primitives--

906
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:51,870
hash functions and
digital signatures.

907
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:54,600
How many people think
they kind of roughly have

908
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:58,070
what a hash function is?

909
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,570
All right, so I
lost half of you.

910
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:00,450
[LAUGHTER]

911
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:03,910
All right, is there anything
I can do for Lauren's table?

912
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:05,360
I didn't see a
single hand go up.

913
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:10,640
Are you reading
your Facebook page

914
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,500
or are you listening
to the class?

915
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:13,760
You've got your computer open.

916
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,580
What's your name.

917
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:15,330
AUDIENCE: Matthew.

918
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:16,880
GARY GENSLER: Matthew.

919
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,770
All right, that might
have been that you

920
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:19,062
weren't listening to the class.

921
00:45:19,062 --> 00:45:20,830
Thank you.

922
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:23,350
How can I help in what
a hash function is?

923
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:26,900
My promise is to
bring everybody along.

924
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:29,540
Nobody at your table
said you even roughly got

925
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:30,720
what a hash function is.

926
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,020
I'm not trying to
embarrass anybody.

927
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:40,150
I'm trying to work this through.

928
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:44,920
Nicholas, so give me a baseline.

929
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:47,570
Did you read any
of the readings?

930
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:48,470
Maybe not.

931
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:49,176
OK.

932
00:45:49,176 --> 00:45:50,480
AUDIENCE: I have, yes.

933
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,760
GARY GENSLER: You have, OK.

934
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:56,690
Hash functions came
along decades ago

935
00:45:56,690 --> 00:46:00,360
to help facilitate
database management.

936
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:03,590
Sometimes it's
called a registry.

937
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:07,520
It's taking a lot of data
and shrinking it down,

938
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:11,780
compressing it, shrinking it,
to maybe a series of numbers.

939
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:17,810
I think of it sometimes as
a zip code for information.

940
00:46:17,810 --> 00:46:21,330
Down in Baltimore,
Maryland, I'm in 2120--

941
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:24,290
well, I grew up in 21208.

942
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:25,700
It was my parent's zip code.

943
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:28,370
I won't say my current.

944
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:29,654
We're being videoed.

945
00:46:29,654 --> 00:46:31,430
[LAUGHTER]

946
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:34,490
And so I think of it a
little bit like that.

947
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:37,610
So a hash function that has
nothing to do with bitcoin

948
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:42,440
came along to take a bunch of
data and create a registry.

949
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:46,580
But through that, it also
became a way to do a commitment.

950
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:47,810
Yes, your first name?

951
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:48,768
AUDIENCE: Dana.

952
00:46:48,768 --> 00:46:49,560
GARY GENSLER: Dana?

953
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,435
AUDIENCE: Yeah, Dana.

954
00:46:50,435 --> 00:46:53,510
What goes into the hash function
and comes out as a hash,

955
00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:54,920
that's what I don't understand.

956
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,950
GARY GENSLER: So what goes
in is any set of data.

957
00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:01,060
Today, that could
be an entire movie.

958
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:03,960
It could be a picture of
everybody in this room.

959
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:12,940
Initially, it was mostly
alphanumeric data.

960
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:15,570
But because, in
computer technology,

961
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:21,570
all data can be broken down
to a series of registries

962
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:22,860
of 0's or 1's--

963
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:33,020
computers started with--
literally the first one

964
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:38,780
started with registries that
were either turned on or off.

965
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:40,880
If they were on, call that a 1.

966
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,590
If it was off, call it a 0.

967
00:47:42,590 --> 00:47:45,110
I'm not sure which way it goes.

968
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:48,500
I keep looking at Alin.

969
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:52,500
And so all data can
then be brought down

970
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,130
to a series of 0's and 1.

971
00:47:55,130 --> 00:47:59,600
And if you put four 0's and 1's
in front of each other, 2 times

972
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:05,450
2 times 2 times 2, 2 to the
fourth is 16, all of a sudden,

973
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:07,820
you see if you keep
going 2 to something,

974
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:10,140
you can get a lot of data.

975
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:13,230
So sit back to
answer your question

976
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:16,380
Dana, when we talked last
week about The New York Times

977
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:17,370
crossword puzzle--

978
00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:20,190
The New York Times
may, if they wish,

979
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:25,860
take the solution of their
crossword puzzle and hash it.

980
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:28,505
And then Stephanie?

981
00:48:28,505 --> 00:48:29,130
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

982
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:31,380
GARY GENSLER: Stephanie likes
to do The New York Times

983
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:33,370
crossword puzzle.

984
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:36,880
And she wants to know if she
properly completed The New York

985
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,380
Times crossword puzzle.

986
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:42,400
The New York Times could
say to her cell phone,

987
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,490
we're not going to really
give you the answer,

988
00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:49,232
but we'll give you the
hash of the answer.

989
00:48:49,232 --> 00:48:51,440
And then when she's finished
and she pushes a button,

990
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:57,400
her application could say
whether her answer properly

991
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,510
hashes to theirs.

992
00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:00,870
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

993
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:01,180
GARY GENSLER: Please.

994
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:02,660
We're trying to
learn here together.

995
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:04,243
AUDIENCE: In the
case of a blockchain,

996
00:49:04,243 --> 00:49:06,730
it's whatever dated you
loaded to the blockchain,

997
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:09,150
and then in Bitcoin, it's
just the transactions.

998
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:10,570
Is that right?

999
00:49:10,570 --> 00:49:14,260
GARY GENSLER: So in
Bitcoin and blockchain,

1000
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:18,550
they use hash functions
in several big ways.

1001
00:49:21,250 --> 00:49:24,220
Everything you said was
correct, except for the one

1002
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:26,320
thing when you said, it's just.

1003
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:30,310
Because they actually use
hash functions in the middle

1004
00:49:30,310 --> 00:49:31,330
of the proof of work.

1005
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:37,540
Because the hash
pointer points--

1006
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:41,480
block 3 points to block
2 and there's hashing.

1007
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:45,220
They use the hash function to
compress a bunch of data, what

1008
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:47,200
I call the Merkle
Tree, but it's taking

1009
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:52,990
1,500 or 2,000 transactions
and squeezing it into one hash.

1010
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:56,160
So they're hashing all
of these things up.

1011
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:01,550
It uses hash functions in the
midst of the Bitcoin address.

1012
00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:05,140
So the hash function
is like electricity

1013
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:07,000
in the middle of it, almost.

1014
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,090
It's probably used
six or eight places,

1015
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:13,690
and some I don't, in
any way, know myself

1016
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:15,687
or need to understand.

1017
00:50:15,687 --> 00:50:16,770
Nicolas, how are we doing?

1018
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:17,930
Did we get a little closer?

1019
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:18,660
AUDIENCE: Yes.

1020
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:20,702
GARY GENSLER: Lauren, did
we get a little closer?

1021
00:50:20,702 --> 00:50:21,408
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1022
00:50:21,408 --> 00:50:22,200
GARY GENSLER: Matt?

1023
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:22,992
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

1024
00:50:22,992 --> 00:50:24,457
GARY GENSLER: You're there.

1025
00:50:24,457 --> 00:50:26,290
AUDIENCE: I'm not there
yet, but I'm closer.

1026
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:27,020
GARY GENSLER: Stop by.

1027
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:27,860
Send me an email.

1028
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,598
It's gensler@mit.edu.

1029
00:50:29,598 --> 00:50:30,890
I'm here like four days a week.

1030
00:50:30,890 --> 00:50:31,918
Ben.

1031
00:50:31,918 --> 00:50:33,710
AUDIENCE: So I think
the time that I really

1032
00:50:33,710 --> 00:50:35,255
understood hash
functions was when

1033
00:50:35,255 --> 00:50:37,820
I saw someone do a live demo.

1034
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:39,950
It's a website called
[INAUDIBLE] Brain Wallet.

1035
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:43,070
But you type in text,
and in real time,

1036
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:44,780
it converts it into a hash.

1037
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:45,280
So

1038
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,150
GARY GENSLER: Say the
website again, Ben.

1039
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:49,640
AUDIENCE: It's brainwallet.io.

1040
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:52,620
GARY GENSLER: Brainwallet.io--
a recommendation.

1041
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:55,840
AUDIENCE: You can also just
Google Brain Wallet blockchain.

1042
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:58,200
And you can type in text,
and you see in real time

1043
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,890
it converts it into
a Bitcoin address.

1044
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,810
If you change one letter, or
make one in uppercase or one

1045
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:04,550
in lower case, it
changes in real time.

1046
00:51:04,550 --> 00:51:08,280
And it's just, you put any
text in, you put a password in,

1047
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,248
and it turns it into
a blockchain address.

1048
00:51:10,248 --> 00:51:11,290
And that's all a hash is.

1049
00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:14,518
It translates text into a hash.

1050
00:51:14,518 --> 00:51:15,810
GARY GENSLER: Or a whole movie.

1051
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:21,490
We talked about the
network consensus,

1052
00:51:21,490 --> 00:51:28,000
how to actually agree on
the state of information

1053
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,020
with no centralized authority.

1054
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:35,200
You don't have a central
bank or a commercial bank

1055
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:42,490
or a Facebook or a
parental unit, if you wish.

1056
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:44,680
It's all of us out
there on the playground

1057
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,550
figuring it out
together somehow.

1058
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:52,670
AUDIENCE: Sorry, I
have a quesiton here.

1059
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:55,085
For the proof of
work, my question

1060
00:51:55,085 --> 00:51:57,320
is, for example, I
make a transaction,

1061
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:00,440
does it mean I have to wait for
10 minutes for the transaction

1062
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:02,780
to be completed?

1063
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:07,340
Or for example, when we do
Venmo, it's like instantaneous.

1064
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:10,030
I can immediately
get the results.

1065
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:11,780
GARY GENSLER: Anton's
question is, does it

1066
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:13,280
mean I have to wait 10 minutes?

1067
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:18,050
Venmo and so many other payment
practices can go more quickly.

1068
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:22,250
The answer to you is, yes.

1069
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:26,350
And that is one of the
commercial challenges

1070
00:52:26,350 --> 00:52:30,770
to blockchain as we
know it in Bitcoin.

1071
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:36,980
There are certain approaches
to that, layering in technology

1072
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:39,552
on top of, they call it
layer 2 or lightning network.

1073
00:52:39,552 --> 00:52:41,510
We're not going to dive
into lightning network.

1074
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:45,160
But everybody should hold
onto Anton's question.

1075
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:47,930
It's the right question,
that if all of you

1076
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:52,130
bring your critical reasoning
to this class about markets

1077
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:56,300
and about commercial realities,
a little bit about the law

1078
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:57,905
and a little bit
about technology.

1079
00:52:57,905 --> 00:52:59,530
Because that's what
we're trying to do.

1080
00:52:59,530 --> 00:53:01,940
It's like, oh, well
does this really matter?

1081
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:02,510
Will it work?

1082
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:03,080
Hugo.

1083
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,458
AUDIENCE: So just a point
of contention here--

1084
00:53:05,458 --> 00:53:06,500
GARY GENSLER: Contention?

1085
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:07,110
AUDIENCE: A little bit.

1086
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:08,277
GARY GENSLER: Oh, very good.

1087
00:53:08,277 --> 00:53:08,840
I like that.

1088
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,750
AUDIENCE: So if
you know the person

1089
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:14,390
that you're transacting with,
you can accept the transaction

1090
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:15,590
with 0 confirmations.

1091
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:17,330
As long as it gets
into the mem pool

1092
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:19,910
and has a reasonable
fee attached to it,

1093
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:22,260
then it will eventually
get included on a block,

1094
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:24,260
and that's probably good
enough for most people.

1095
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:27,950
GARY GENSLER: So what
Hugo is saying is,

1096
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:34,060
another approach is to
take counterparty risk,

1097
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:34,863
that Anton's--

1098
00:53:34,863 --> 00:53:36,280
back to Anton's
question-- does it

1099
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:37,990
mean you have to
wait 10 minutes?

1100
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:40,030
The actual technical
answer to that

1101
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:45,880
is, no, you don't have to wait
10 minutes, unless you want

1102
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:50,020
final settlement,
if you want finality

1103
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:56,140
with no counterparty
risk, no commercial risk.

1104
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:58,060
Hugo is saying, well,
if I'm willing to take

1105
00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:01,660
some economic or commercial
counterparty risk, which is,

1106
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:05,470
in finance, you take
it all the time,

1107
00:54:05,470 --> 00:54:08,380
then maybe I can do it
in less than 10 minutes.

1108
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:10,720
And in fact, even
Starbucks, when

1109
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:14,470
Starbucks accepts your
credit card swipe,

1110
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:17,170
they're taking a little
bit of counterparty risk

1111
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:21,010
from the payment processing
company First Data.

1112
00:54:21,010 --> 00:54:24,010
I don't mean to say that
it might not be also

1113
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:25,450
from Visa and the banks.

1114
00:54:25,450 --> 00:54:28,210
But I'll just say
the payment system

1115
00:54:28,210 --> 00:54:30,490
has some counterparty risk.

1116
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:32,890
Because final settlement
in our payment

1117
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:36,420
system doesn't happen
within seconds.

1118
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:39,210
So the actual answer--
thank you, Hugo.

1119
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:40,470
Clean me up again.

1120
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:42,750
You should do this all the time.

1121
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:44,520
Everybody should clean me up.

1122
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:46,720
It's that final
settlement can happen.

1123
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,433
And so you have to
find other solutions,

1124
00:54:48,433 --> 00:54:50,100
whether it's some
commercial arrangement

1125
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:53,228
with counterparty risk or
other technical commercial

1126
00:54:53,228 --> 00:54:53,770
arrangements.

1127
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:54,290
Shimon?

1128
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:56,770
AUDIENCE: Well, I'll
make a counterargument,

1129
00:54:56,770 --> 00:55:00,065
which is that, 10 minutes is
not final settlement, right?

1130
00:55:00,065 --> 00:55:01,290
Because it could be forking.

1131
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:04,630
So it's basically
the probability

1132
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:08,380
of the finality
goes up with time,

1133
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:12,120
which is associated with how
many blocks are attached to

1134
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,500
[INAUDIBLE].

1135
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:17,980
GARY GENSLER: So Shimon's point
is that, even in 10 minutes,

1136
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:23,000
your probability of
finality is not complete.

1137
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,470
Because the block
might not be the block

1138
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:29,840
that's included in
the longest chain.

1139
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:32,510
And many people
have said, you maybe

1140
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:34,620
should wait three
blocks or six blocks.

1141
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:35,495
I think the longest--

1142
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:40,370
I'm going to use
the term loosely--

1143
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:46,110
orphaned chain has
been five blocks long.

1144
00:55:46,110 --> 00:55:49,140
And in Bitcoin, what's
the longest orphan?

1145
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:50,640
AUDIENCE: It was
an accidental fork.

1146
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,240
It was 20 or more blocks.

1147
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:56,127
Due to some crazy things
that miners were doing,

1148
00:55:56,127 --> 00:55:57,710
they accidentally
forked a blockchain.

1149
00:55:57,710 --> 00:55:59,720
AUDIENCE: OK, and
what year was that?

1150
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:02,020
AUDIENCE: So look
up March 2013 fork.

1151
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:04,815
And there's another fork
after that, in 2015 maybe.

1152
00:56:04,815 --> 00:56:07,190
GARY GENSLER: Yeah, somebody's
been down the rabbit hole.

1153
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:07,690
[LAUGHTER]

1154
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:12,830
All right, there's some
still probabilistic risk.

1155
00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:15,155
Aviva, and then we'll move on.

1156
00:56:15,155 --> 00:56:17,450
AUDIENCE: What's a fork.

1157
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:19,400
GARY GENSLER: So I
don't have the chart up.

1158
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:23,590
But if you remember,
there was the slide

1159
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:25,270
that showed the longest block.

1160
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:26,920
It was in black.

1161
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:29,740
And it had little purple blocks.

1162
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:31,780
That's a fork.

1163
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:39,030
There's some forks that end up
being that both chains continue

1164
00:56:39,030 --> 00:56:40,140
for a long time.

1165
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:41,550
They're called hard forks.

1166
00:56:41,550 --> 00:56:43,110
And there is something called--

1167
00:56:43,110 --> 00:56:46,080
Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash
have come out of that.

1168
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:52,963
Most, the way that Alin was
using it, are discarded.

1169
00:56:52,963 --> 00:56:55,130
I'm sorry, behind you,
remind me of your first name?

1170
00:56:55,130 --> 00:56:57,538
AUDIENCE: Erin.

1171
00:56:57,538 --> 00:56:58,080
I don't know.

1172
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,550
Let me know if it's
not the right time

1173
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:00,425
to ask this question.

1174
00:57:00,425 --> 00:57:03,922
But I'm getting a bit confused
between the most important

1175
00:57:03,922 --> 00:57:05,880
things we now need to
know, and the differences

1176
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:09,870
between the technology of
mining Bitcoins versus just

1177
00:57:09,870 --> 00:57:14,220
transacting on the blockchain.

1178
00:57:18,622 --> 00:57:20,580
What are the major
differences we need to know?

1179
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:23,460
GARY GENSLER: Very
good question, Erin.

1180
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:27,300
Erin's question of, what do
I need to know about mining,

1181
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:29,010
what do I need to know
about transaction,

1182
00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:30,510
is it one and the same?

1183
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:31,680
I apologize.

1184
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,940
They overlap, but
they're not the same.

1185
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:35,805
So think of a Venn diagram.

1186
00:57:35,805 --> 00:57:38,610
But it's a very good question.

1187
00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:46,710
The essence of mining is
creating an incentive structure

1188
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:50,520
where there is no
central authority

1189
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:56,850
to validate and put a new
set of transactions or data--

1190
00:57:56,850 --> 00:57:59,310
I'm going to say broadly, data--

1191
00:57:59,310 --> 00:58:06,050
into the ledger, into the
accepted state of what

1192
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:08,480
reality is.

1193
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,010
So mining helps with that.

1194
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:12,030
That's that whole process.

1195
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:15,770
In essence, who gets to
decide the next block of data?

1196
00:58:15,770 --> 00:58:21,430
Transactions are included in the
data, but it's not identical.

1197
00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:27,880
Mining is really critical, but
it's not the only component.

1198
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:30,233
In terms of
transactions, then you

1199
00:58:30,233 --> 00:58:31,900
have to actually think
of, well, there's

1200
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:33,300
this other thing going on.

1201
00:58:33,300 --> 00:58:36,970
Well, there's been 340 million
of these in the Bitcoin network

1202
00:58:36,970 --> 00:58:38,470
so far.

1203
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:41,280
And has it been used already?

1204
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,270
Has it been spent?

1205
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:45,880
Does it have an appropriate
digital signature?

1206
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:49,570
If there's a time lock on
it, is there a condition?

1207
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:52,030
Might there even be this
little bit of scripting code

1208
00:58:52,030 --> 00:58:53,830
that puts other
conditions, like there

1209
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:57,150
has to be multiple signatures?

1210
00:58:57,150 --> 00:58:58,275
Has it been double spent?

1211
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:04,230
It was a very good question.

1212
00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:06,492
They overlap a lot.

1213
00:59:06,492 --> 00:59:07,950
One thing you can
just remember is,

1214
00:59:07,950 --> 00:59:10,830
mining is about that there's
been a half a million blocks.

1215
00:59:10,830 --> 00:59:13,800
Transactions, there's
been 340 million.

1216
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,370
So there must be
something else going on

1217
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:17,730
in all those transactions.

1218
00:59:17,730 --> 00:59:20,430
Does that help a bit?

1219
00:59:20,430 --> 00:59:21,865
Kelly?

1220
00:59:21,865 --> 00:59:23,490
AUDIENCE: Since we're
talking about all

1221
00:59:23,490 --> 00:59:25,590
the technical features
and how they overlap,

1222
00:59:25,590 --> 00:59:30,270
one of the questions was,
what part of blockchain

1223
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:32,927
is novel to Satoshi?

1224
00:59:37,310 --> 00:59:39,480
Is the novelty in
bringing it all together,

1225
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,190
or is it one specific thing?

1226
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:43,770
Because the paper
talked about the ledger

1227
00:59:43,770 --> 00:59:46,650
and creating the
incentive, and then

1228
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:49,350
sort of solving the whole
Byzantine Generals Problem.

1229
00:59:49,350 --> 00:59:51,570
But I don't really understand.

1230
00:59:51,570 --> 00:59:54,810
Was there a specific
thing that unlocked the--

1231
00:59:54,810 --> 00:59:56,520
GARY GENSLER: So
Kelly's question,

1232
00:59:56,520 --> 01:00:00,420
which is the heart of the
study questions is, what makes

1233
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:02,610
the whole Satoshi paper novel?

1234
01:00:02,610 --> 01:00:06,070
Is it just bringing
it all together,

1235
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:08,430
or is there something more?

1236
01:00:08,430 --> 01:00:09,370
I'll give you a hint.

1237
01:00:09,370 --> 01:00:10,630
I think there's one other--

1238
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:15,540
I think that the genius can
be just in bringing together

1239
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:16,880
things.

1240
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:19,770
That in itself can
be sheer genius.

1241
01:00:19,770 --> 01:00:21,840
AUDIENCE: There's also
the part that, creating

1242
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,430
the value in the currency.

1243
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:24,770
But I don't know if that's--

1244
01:00:24,770 --> 01:00:27,870
GARY GENSLER: Right, so
creating an incentive structure

1245
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:30,500
within there.

1246
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,420
Others?

1247
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:32,920
Derek.

1248
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:33,930
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
have a question.

1249
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:35,790
GARY GENSLER: Question, or
answer to Kelly's question?

1250
01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:36,790
AUDIENCE: No, I had a question.

1251
01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:37,890
GARY GENSLER: All right, I'm
going to hold your question,

1252
01:00:37,890 --> 01:00:38,932
Derek, just for a second.

1253
01:00:38,932 --> 01:00:41,040
Who's going to help
me with-- because it's

1254
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,492
central to the study questions.

1255
01:00:44,492 --> 01:00:46,975
AUDIENCE: Just
another thing to add--

1256
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:50,950
the proof of work that
Satoshi did on the consensus

1257
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:52,748
to [INAUDIBLE] it's also novel.

1258
01:00:52,748 --> 01:00:53,540
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

1259
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:56,790
But novel, though,
didn't Adam Back

1260
01:00:56,790 --> 01:00:59,760
already do some
of it in hashcash.

1261
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,700
So its application was novel.

1262
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:05,250
I come out where I think
the genius is bringing it

1263
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:11,530
all together, and using
Adam Back's proof of work

1264
01:01:11,530 --> 01:01:15,370
in a way that really
addressed double spend.

1265
01:01:15,370 --> 01:01:17,890
Adam Back was not dealing
with a double spend issue.

1266
01:01:17,890 --> 01:01:19,260
He had different challenges.

1267
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:21,340
It was about email spam.

1268
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:23,152
Frankly, it didn't
even work with email.

1269
01:01:23,152 --> 01:01:25,360
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] we
weren't counting [INAUDIBLE]

1270
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:27,475
work as a completely
novel thing,

1271
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:30,550
his article discussed how
it was already published.

1272
01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:31,960
So I guess it's the application.

1273
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:34,000
GARY GENSLER: It's the
application specifically

1274
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,865
to the double spend.

1275
01:01:36,865 --> 01:01:41,470
Now, Patrick Murck,
would you answer it then?

1276
01:01:41,470 --> 01:01:43,840
This is somebody who ran
the Bitcoin Foundation,

1277
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:46,832
but he's a lawyer, you know?

1278
01:01:46,832 --> 01:01:48,790
PATRICK MURCK: I think
that's absolutely right.

1279
01:01:48,790 --> 01:01:51,870
So usually-- and I think they
address it in that particular

1280
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:52,480
paper--

1281
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,050
when somebody says,
what was a thing

1282
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:56,300
that was different about
Bitcoin from everything else,

1283
01:01:56,300 --> 01:01:59,020
the answer is Nakamoto
Consensus, right?

1284
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:02,410
And Nakamoto Consensus,
being the incentive structure

1285
01:02:02,410 --> 01:02:05,050
pulling everything together
and aligning everybody

1286
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:07,720
to actually create
trusted signing parties

1287
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:10,900
for this database, without
having to actually trust

1288
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:12,990
or identify those parties.

1289
01:02:12,990 --> 01:02:16,670
And that's something that
really hadn't existed before.

1290
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:18,520
And so that's really novel.

1291
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:21,280
That's sort of the
breakthrough that I

1292
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:25,570
think you can attribute to
that particular white paper.

1293
01:02:25,570 --> 01:02:27,730
I also use this as a way
to give a clean definition

1294
01:02:27,730 --> 01:02:30,550
of blockchain, which is a
badly abused term, as I'm

1295
01:02:30,550 --> 01:02:33,955
sure you'll discover through
the rest of this class.

1296
01:02:33,955 --> 01:02:36,100
It's saying, to
me, a blockchain is

1297
01:02:36,100 --> 01:02:40,248
something that is born
from Nakamoto Consensus.

1298
01:02:40,248 --> 01:02:42,040
Blockchains, as they
discuss in that paper,

1299
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:44,080
have existed for decades.

1300
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:46,590
That's not even a
novel data structure.

1301
01:02:46,590 --> 01:02:49,270
But using that to form Nakamoto
Con-- that's the thing.

1302
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:52,520
It always sort of
comes back to that.

1303
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:55,348
Anyways, maybe a longer
elaboration than you wanted.

1304
01:02:55,348 --> 01:02:56,890
GARY GENSLER: Good,
there we have it.

1305
01:02:56,890 --> 01:03:00,145
You now know that you're in a
class that has guest speakers.

1306
01:03:02,657 --> 01:03:04,990
I do want to say on the guest
speaker point-- and Derek,

1307
01:03:04,990 --> 01:03:07,830
I cognizant that
you have a question,

1308
01:03:07,830 --> 01:03:12,790
but we have 12 minutes or so.

1309
01:03:12,790 --> 01:03:16,030
Next Tuesday, Larry
Lessig, who sometimes

1310
01:03:16,030 --> 01:03:20,530
floats into this class,
has agreed to guest lecture

1311
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:21,530
with me.

1312
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:23,440
And so we're going to
co-do smart contracts.

1313
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:26,080
And let me just say a
little bit about Larry.

1314
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:27,160
You sort of see him here.

1315
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:29,270
He bicycles over from Harvard.

1316
01:03:29,270 --> 01:03:31,150
He's a constitutional
scholar that's

1317
01:03:31,150 --> 01:03:33,080
a remarkable
constitutional scholar.

1318
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:36,250
And even though he came to be
a full professor at Harvard,

1319
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:38,110
they stole him away
from Stanford actually,

1320
01:03:38,110 --> 01:03:41,420
where he was a full
professor, too, readily.

1321
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:44,530
But he's extensively written.

1322
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:48,110
Anybody in here a West Wing
fan, the television series

1323
01:03:48,110 --> 01:03:50,660
West Wing?

1324
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,350
He is the only--

1325
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:54,822
do you know that Larry
Lessig was in West Wing?

1326
01:03:54,822 --> 01:03:55,970
AUDIENCE: No.

1327
01:03:55,970 --> 01:03:57,470
GARY GENSLER: Now you do.

1328
01:03:57,470 --> 01:03:58,340
Well, Larry was.

1329
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:02,360
And Christopher Lloyd played
Larry Lessig in one episode.

1330
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:05,400
But you'll go back and
you'll find the episode.

1331
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:09,560
And Larry has a funny
story about watching

1332
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:10,940
the filming of it.

1333
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:15,320
But Larry is a constitutional
scholar over at Harvard.

1334
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:20,030
He clerked for Justice
Scalia on the Supreme Court.

1335
01:04:20,030 --> 01:04:25,580
He clerked for Posner
over in Chicago.

1336
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:27,140
He knows a lot about contracts.

1337
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:29,810
And so I asked him if he'd
help teach smart contracts

1338
01:04:29,810 --> 01:04:30,600
next Tuesday.

1339
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:32,933
So Larry's going to-- we're
going to Mutt and Jeff it up

1340
01:04:32,933 --> 01:04:35,240
here next Tuesday.

1341
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:36,140
Watch out, Patrick.

1342
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:38,237
You might be up here one day.

1343
01:04:38,237 --> 01:04:40,070
This is not a class
that we're going to have

1344
01:04:40,070 --> 01:04:42,110
a lot of guest lecturers.

1345
01:04:42,110 --> 01:04:44,340
Later in this
semester, I hope, we're

1346
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:46,310
still in confirming
Jeff Sprecher, who's

1347
01:04:46,310 --> 01:04:49,825
the chief executive officer
of Intercontinental Exchange,

1348
01:04:49,825 --> 01:04:51,200
runs the New York
Stock Exchange.

1349
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:56,480
Jeff is probably joining us
on, I think it's November 15.

1350
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:01,700
But I really want to stay
to the content and so forth.

1351
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:03,418
Derek, what's your question?

1352
01:05:03,418 --> 01:05:05,210
AUDIENCE: I can follow
up with you on that.

1353
01:05:05,210 --> 01:05:06,377
GARY GENSLER: OK, follow up.

1354
01:05:06,377 --> 01:05:08,790
All right, and then we just
did transactions today.

1355
01:05:08,790 --> 01:05:12,110
Remember, the hash function
is The New York Times.

1356
01:05:12,110 --> 01:05:16,400
We're in a little better
place with Lauren's table now.

1357
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:19,730
All right, good, good.

1358
01:05:19,730 --> 01:05:21,765
My goal is not to
embarrass anybody

1359
01:05:21,765 --> 01:05:22,890
when I ask these questions.

1360
01:05:22,890 --> 01:05:25,790
My goal is that we all
come along on this journey,

1361
01:05:25,790 --> 01:05:27,890
that we somehow have some basis.

1362
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:29,990
Because it does relate
to understanding

1363
01:05:29,990 --> 01:05:33,800
the commercial reality
and the economics.

1364
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:38,020
We talked about the time
stamping and the blocks,

1365
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:41,940
the Merkle Trees, which is not a
deep part of it, and of course,

1366
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:43,280
digital signatures.

1367
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:45,470
Part of the reason I
replay this each time

1368
01:05:45,470 --> 01:05:47,090
is because, in
politics, I, of course,

1369
01:05:47,090 --> 01:05:49,710
learned that repetition is
a really important thing.

1370
01:05:49,710 --> 01:05:50,210
[LAUGHTER]

1371
01:05:50,210 --> 01:05:55,280
But I also think it's
true in academic settings.

1372
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:58,160
And then Bitcoin addresses,
and that's just a cleanup,

1373
01:05:58,160 --> 01:06:00,890
that it's not an
identical to a public.

1374
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:03,800
And then the proof of work,
and back to the questions.

1375
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:06,770
Nakamoto Consensus
is, yes, all of this

1376
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:11,060
and an incentive structure,
but it's this proof of work.

1377
01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:14,450
And to Erin's
question, proof of work

1378
01:06:14,450 --> 01:06:16,550
is a little bit different
than the transactions

1379
01:06:16,550 --> 01:06:20,160
that we talked about, but
there's a lot of overlap.

1380
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:22,230
And then it creates
the native currency.

1381
01:06:22,230 --> 01:06:28,810
And I've corrected this
slide to 2140, of course.

1382
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:31,490
The network is
really critical, too,

1383
01:06:31,490 --> 01:06:33,360
and that there's all
these different actors

1384
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:37,530
on a network, 10,000 nodes
and this many light nodes

1385
01:06:37,530 --> 01:06:39,690
and the miners and the
mining pool operators.

1386
01:06:39,690 --> 01:06:43,320
And they all have their
separate economics.

1387
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:45,900
And so if anybody wants to
come and get office hours,

1388
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:49,440
talk about those economics,
please come on in.

1389
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,870
If there's nothing you
remember from the reading,

1390
01:06:51,870 --> 01:06:55,200
I've now read this
paper probably six times

1391
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,930
to kind of slowly get
it through my head.

1392
01:06:57,930 --> 01:07:00,870
But every time I
read the Clark paper,

1393
01:07:00,870 --> 01:07:03,930
I go, wow, that really helps me.

1394
01:07:03,930 --> 01:07:07,590
Because it's not like
Satoshi Nakamoto just flipped

1395
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:09,570
his fingers and there it--

1396
01:07:09,570 --> 01:07:13,020
it was on the backs of
a lot of cryptography,

1397
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:15,850
a lot of technology earlier.

1398
01:07:15,850 --> 01:07:17,610
But this is the
chart I turn back to,

1399
01:07:17,610 --> 01:07:19,140
and it's sometimes helps me.

1400
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:22,590
Ah, there's time-stamping,
there's digital cache,

1401
01:07:22,590 --> 01:07:26,280
there's proof of work,
and how these things.

1402
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,200
Maybe 10 years from
now, they'll look back

1403
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:30,600
and Nakamoto's stuff
will just be built upon.

1404
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,100
That's the central question.

1405
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:34,290
That's what some
of our colleagues

1406
01:07:34,290 --> 01:07:36,600
are doing over at the
Digital Currency Initiative

1407
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:38,610
or over at the
Computer Sciences Lab.

1408
01:07:38,610 --> 01:07:41,190
They're saying, can
they build upon this

1409
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:44,283
and take it to another level?

1410
01:07:44,283 --> 01:07:46,450
Right now-- and you'll see
throughout the semester--

1411
01:07:46,450 --> 01:07:49,290
there's not a lot of
full scale applications

1412
01:07:49,290 --> 01:07:52,310
of this technology.

1413
01:07:52,310 --> 01:07:54,380
But it might just be in
a whole line of this.

1414
01:07:54,380 --> 01:07:56,422
Yes, and I can't remember
your first name, Aviva?

1415
01:07:56,422 --> 01:07:57,820
AUDIENCE: I'm Aviva.

1416
01:07:57,820 --> 01:07:59,340
And that is the
other Indian woman.

1417
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:00,170
GARY GENSLER: That's
the other Aviva.

1418
01:08:00,170 --> 01:08:01,837
AUDIENCE: That's the
other Indian woman.

1419
01:08:01,837 --> 01:08:03,545
GARY GENSLER: Yeah,
yeah, it's important.

1420
01:08:03,545 --> 01:08:05,783
Out of 100 people, we can
have two Avivas, you know?

1421
01:08:05,783 --> 01:08:07,700
We could even have two
Aviva's if there's two.

1422
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:09,550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
name's Priya.

1423
01:08:09,550 --> 01:08:10,466
AUDIENCE: I'm Priya.

1424
01:08:10,466 --> 01:08:12,950
GARY GENSLER: Pria--
oh, I'm sorry.

1425
01:08:12,950 --> 01:08:13,900
Thank you.

1426
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:15,770
AUDIENCE: So I was
just thinking about,

1427
01:08:15,770 --> 01:08:19,229
as one of the applications
of the hash function--

1428
01:08:19,229 --> 01:08:24,040
so does the hash function
actually replace the data?

1429
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:27,319
So I'm thinking now that
everyone's saving data

1430
01:08:27,319 --> 01:08:30,560
in the cloud, so can you
save a hash function instead

1431
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:34,142
of your actual data, and
then so it can be compressed?

1432
01:08:34,142 --> 01:08:36,350
GARY GENSLER: Very good
question-- my summary of it--

1433
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:38,899
though others' probably
would be more expert.

1434
01:08:38,899 --> 01:08:40,470
My summary is, you get a choice.

1435
01:08:40,470 --> 01:08:41,970
You could do either.

1436
01:08:41,970 --> 01:08:46,840
So let's take it in blockchain
rather than in the cloud.

1437
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:51,790
You can choose to save in
a blockchain just hashes,

1438
01:08:51,790 --> 01:08:55,569
and have the full
picture somewhere else.

1439
01:08:55,569 --> 01:08:59,580
Let's say you were going
to do a whole database of--

1440
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:00,623
AUDIENCE: A library.

1441
01:09:00,623 --> 01:09:01,540
GARY GENSLER: Of what?

1442
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:02,915
AUDIENCE: I'd say
like a library.

1443
01:09:02,915 --> 01:09:04,600
GARY GENSLER: A library--

1444
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:07,510
and so there's 100,000
books in the library.

1445
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:09,760
You could hash
all 100,000 books,

1446
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:15,069
and then store the hashes in
the blockchain and not the books

1447
01:09:15,069 --> 01:09:16,720
themselves.

1448
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:19,420
And that would form a
blockchain of the commitments

1449
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:20,680
to those books.

1450
01:09:20,680 --> 01:09:25,149
Or you could actually, I
guess, put the books themselves

1451
01:09:25,149 --> 01:09:26,229
into the blockchain.

1452
01:09:26,229 --> 01:09:29,359
Now, I saw some shaking
heads in the middle.

1453
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:33,010
Alin from the Digital
Currency Initiative.

1454
01:09:33,010 --> 01:09:35,670
AUDIENCE: The way I understand
this is, the answer is no.

1455
01:09:38,979 --> 01:09:40,720
You can store the hash.

1456
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:42,556
That doesn't replace the data.

1457
01:09:42,556 --> 01:09:45,460
The storing of the hash
allows you to prove

1458
01:09:45,460 --> 01:09:47,500
that you have the data.

1459
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,460
But the fact that
you store the hash

1460
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:51,520
doesn't mean that
you store the data.

1461
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:57,190
GARY GENSLER: But Alin,
there's a two-part question.

1462
01:09:57,190 --> 01:09:59,050
You shouldn't get
rid of the book,

1463
01:09:59,050 --> 01:10:02,140
because hashes are one way.

1464
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:06,370
You're not able to take the
hash and recreate the look.

1465
01:10:06,370 --> 01:10:09,040
You can't take the hash and
recreate The New York Times

1466
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:11,070
crossword puzzle.

1467
01:10:11,070 --> 01:10:13,275
But you don't need to store
them in the same place.

1468
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:18,090
Thank you, because it's
two parts the question.

1469
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:20,850
You could store the
hashes in the cloud

1470
01:10:20,850 --> 01:10:23,400
and store the books
somewhere else.

1471
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,455
But you still need to
store the book, maybe.

1472
01:10:29,390 --> 01:10:32,450
So who is Satoshi Nakamoto?

1473
01:10:32,450 --> 01:10:35,480
We have just a handful of
minutes, but can every table--

1474
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:37,550
each table's going
to take four minutes.

1475
01:10:37,550 --> 01:10:40,550
And amongst yourselves, decide
who is Satoshi Nakamoto.

1476
01:10:40,550 --> 01:10:41,910
So how are we doing?

1477
01:10:41,910 --> 01:10:45,108
Who's your answer
to Satoshi Nakamoto?

1478
01:10:45,108 --> 01:10:47,150
AUDIENCE: We would say,
probably multiple people,

1479
01:10:47,150 --> 01:10:48,500
led by Hal Finney.

1480
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:51,740
GARY GENSLER: OK, so the
first one is, multiple people,

1481
01:10:51,740 --> 01:10:53,480
probably led by Hal Finney.

1482
01:11:00,561 --> 01:11:01,190
AUDIENCE: NSA.

1483
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:05,100
AUDIENCE: Something within the
government or a government.

1484
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:11,370
GARY GENSLER: So table number
2 is, government actor, US

1485
01:11:11,370 --> 01:11:12,796
or foreign.

1486
01:11:12,796 --> 01:11:15,080
AUDIENCE: I don't know if
it matters, but maybe US.

1487
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:17,630
GARY GENSLER: US, but
it might not matter.

1488
01:11:17,630 --> 01:11:18,860
How are we doing over here?

1489
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:20,138
AUDIENCE: Dorian Nakamoto.

1490
01:11:20,138 --> 01:11:21,430
GARY GENSLER: Dorian Nakamoto--

1491
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:27,860
so you're going with
the Newsweek story.

1492
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:30,620
Pria, sorry about the
name thing before.

1493
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:31,620
Your table, who--

1494
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:33,473
AUDIENCE: A bunch
of crypto punks.

1495
01:11:33,473 --> 01:11:35,390
GARY GENSLER: What's
that, a bunch of crypto--

1496
01:11:35,390 --> 01:11:36,260
AUDIENCE: Punks.

1497
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:36,545
GARY GENSLER: Punks.

1498
01:11:36,545 --> 01:11:39,140
AUDIENCE: Plus economists--
it's like a group of people.

1499
01:11:39,140 --> 01:11:42,380
GARY GENSLER: So a group of
crypto punks and economists.

1500
01:11:42,380 --> 01:11:44,720
And how do you spell
crypto punks, though?

1501
01:11:44,720 --> 01:11:46,220
AUDIENCE: Cipher punks.

1502
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:49,565
GARY GENSLER: Cipher punks,
cipher punks, actually.

1503
01:11:52,490 --> 01:11:53,770
Where are we here?

1504
01:11:53,770 --> 01:11:55,280
AUDIENCE: NSA.

1505
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:57,320
GARY GENSLER: Oh,
the NSA, all right.

1506
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:59,697
AUDIENCE: People with
incentive and the capability.

1507
01:11:59,697 --> 01:12:01,655
GARY GENSLER: Oh, so
incentives and capability,

1508
01:12:01,655 --> 01:12:03,170
you think it's NSA.

1509
01:12:03,170 --> 01:12:03,930
AUDIENCE: MIT.

1510
01:12:03,930 --> 01:12:08,150
GARY GENSLER: MIT, oh!

1511
01:12:08,150 --> 01:12:10,520
AUDIENCE: We said, a
guy named Gary Gensler.

1512
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:12,255
[LAUGHTER]

1513
01:12:12,255 --> 01:12:13,880
GARY GENSLER: There
is a word for that,

1514
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:17,090
but I can't say that on tape.

1515
01:12:17,090 --> 01:12:21,940
Kelly, Anton, two Alins
what do we have here, Jihee.

1516
01:12:21,940 --> 01:12:24,410
AUDIENCE: Let's go
with Nick Szabo.

1517
01:12:24,410 --> 01:12:28,610
GARY GENSLER: Nick Szabo,
who wrote the first paper

1518
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:31,410
on smart contracts.

1519
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:34,300
So Aviva is Nick Szabo.

1520
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:35,928
My hash table--

1521
01:12:35,928 --> 01:12:38,020
[LAUGHTER]

1522
01:12:40,487 --> 01:12:41,820
GARY GENSLER: Who do you go for?

1523
01:12:41,820 --> 01:12:44,390
AUDIENCE: We actually
did have him, Szabo.

1524
01:12:44,390 --> 01:12:46,940
GARY GENSLER: All
right, you can say

1525
01:12:46,940 --> 01:12:48,430
another table for Nick Szabo.

1526
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:50,620
Put another vote next to him.

1527
01:12:50,620 --> 01:12:51,400
Here?

1528
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:52,942
AUDIENCE: We're
going with you, Gary.

1529
01:12:52,942 --> 01:12:54,800
GARY GENSLER: No, no, come on.

1530
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:57,860
AUDIENCE: We think it's
Craig Steven Wright.

1531
01:12:57,860 --> 01:13:00,710
GARY GENSLER: Craig
Wright, the Australian.

1532
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:02,270
Oh, my god.

1533
01:13:02,270 --> 01:13:06,350
Oh, Patrick Murck's table
is going to go last.

1534
01:13:06,350 --> 01:13:08,600
Here?

1535
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:11,340
AUDIENCE: Bill Belichick.

1536
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:13,362
GARY GENSLER: Bill Belichick.

1537
01:13:13,362 --> 01:13:16,630
AUDIENCE: Alan Greenspan.

1538
01:13:16,630 --> 01:13:18,630
GARY GENSLER: Alan Greenspan.

1539
01:13:18,630 --> 01:13:20,270
I actually know Alan.

1540
01:13:20,270 --> 01:13:23,110
He's really talented,
but I don't think

1541
01:13:23,110 --> 01:13:25,420
Andrea would let him do this.

1542
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:28,030
Here, who do we have?

1543
01:13:32,935 --> 01:13:33,810
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1544
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:34,560
GARY GENSLER: Who?

1545
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:35,830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE], me.

1546
01:13:35,830 --> 01:13:37,510
GARY GENSLER: No, no, but who--

1547
01:13:37,510 --> 01:13:39,210
you're saying you invented it?

1548
01:13:39,210 --> 01:13:40,450
No, no, this table.

1549
01:13:40,450 --> 01:13:42,450
AUDIENCE: This table is
saying he invented it.

1550
01:13:42,450 --> 01:13:46,990
GARY GENSLER: Nick Szabo,
so another for Nick Szabo.

1551
01:13:46,990 --> 01:13:51,160
So does anybody want to
tell us why it's the NSA?

1552
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:55,960
Oh, Patrick Murck, I'm sorry.

1553
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:57,430
What's this table?

1554
01:13:57,430 --> 01:13:59,980
PATRICK MURCK:
Well, I said, if I--

1555
01:13:59,980 --> 01:14:00,850
so I don't know.

1556
01:14:00,850 --> 01:14:04,720
But if I did know, I would
say that I don't know,

1557
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:06,865
and I would create as much
obfuscation as possible.

1558
01:14:06,865 --> 01:14:08,320
So I think I was
the worst person

1559
01:14:08,320 --> 01:14:09,970
to have at a table for this.

1560
01:14:09,970 --> 01:14:12,220
And I did them nothing but
a disservice in their hunt

1561
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:13,620
for Satoshi.

1562
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:15,185
But I'll let
somebody else speak.

1563
01:14:15,185 --> 01:14:16,335
No, I don't know.

1564
01:14:16,335 --> 01:14:17,710
GARY GENSLER: But
if he did know,

1565
01:14:17,710 --> 01:14:20,480
he would say he doesn't know.

1566
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:24,000
Derek, who did
your table go for?

1567
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,670
AUDIENCE: We said Craig Wright.

1568
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:28,780
PATRICK MURCK: You
can see my influence.

1569
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:31,570
GARY GENSLER: Oh, my gosh.

1570
01:14:31,570 --> 01:14:35,680
So let me ask this, because
it's just for fun, one minute.

1571
01:14:35,680 --> 01:14:38,020
Somebody said that
it was the NSA.

1572
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:39,760
Do you want to say why?

1573
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:41,410
AUDIENCE: Because,
arguably, they

1574
01:14:41,410 --> 01:14:44,830
have the most advanced
cryptography in the world.

1575
01:14:44,830 --> 01:14:49,973
And if anybody was doing
this, to have a system where

1576
01:14:49,973 --> 01:14:52,390
all the dark money in the world
was flowing around instead

1577
01:14:52,390 --> 01:14:56,220
of $100 bills, you would create
this and create it in a way

1578
01:14:56,220 --> 01:14:58,497
where you could hack it
backwards and figure it out.

1579
01:14:58,497 --> 01:14:59,705
And they have the capability.

1580
01:14:59,705 --> 01:15:00,455
GARY GENSLER: Wow.

1581
01:15:00,455 --> 01:15:00,955
Hugo.

1582
01:15:00,955 --> 01:15:03,497
AUDIENCE: More [INAUDIBLE] money
is going through [INAUDIBLE]

1583
01:15:03,497 --> 01:15:05,230
right now than it
is through Bitcoin.

1584
01:15:05,230 --> 01:15:08,820
GARY GENSLER: So Hugo would
say that, if it was the NSA,

1585
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:12,790
it didn't work out
for them too well.

1586
01:15:12,790 --> 01:15:14,860
And those of you who
said Craig Wright,

1587
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:17,380
I heard some others in
the room that said, no.

1588
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:19,600
So who said Craig Wright?

1589
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:23,190
Which two tables
said Craig Wright?

1590
01:15:23,190 --> 01:15:25,460
Isabella and Ben, why did
you pick Craig Wright?

1591
01:15:25,460 --> 01:15:26,906
AUDIENCE: So I
read a bunch of it.

1592
01:15:26,906 --> 01:15:30,762
And basically, people analyzed
the English used in the email,

1593
01:15:30,762 --> 01:15:32,792
and they think it traced
back to Australia.

1594
01:15:32,792 --> 01:15:34,250
And then we
[INAUDIBLE] from there.

1595
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:37,622
GARY GENSLER: All right, so
just the language analytics

1596
01:15:37,622 --> 01:15:38,330
for Craig Wright.

1597
01:15:38,330 --> 01:15:39,950
And those who said
it can't possibly

1598
01:15:39,950 --> 01:15:43,920
be Craig Wright, who did that?

1599
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:45,120
Alin?

1600
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:47,150
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so
he started a website.

1601
01:15:47,150 --> 01:15:49,160
He said, oh, here's
cryptographic proof

1602
01:15:49,160 --> 01:15:50,440
that I'm Satoshi Nakamoto.

1603
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:51,860
But he actually botched it.

1604
01:15:51,860 --> 01:15:53,570
Like, if you are
Nakamoto, you can

1605
01:15:53,570 --> 01:15:56,540
prove you're Nakamoto by
spending the first coin.

1606
01:15:56,540 --> 01:15:59,030
But he couldn't do
that, so come on, man.

1607
01:15:59,030 --> 01:16:01,010
GARY GENSLER: So Alin
says, he failed the test.

1608
01:16:01,010 --> 01:16:04,100
He didn't spend the
first coins from 2009.

1609
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:06,740
Three tables picked Nick Szabo.

1610
01:16:06,740 --> 01:16:11,263
Why'd you pick Nick Szabo, just
any one of the three tables?

1611
01:16:11,263 --> 01:16:13,680
Because we're going to talk
about him in the next lecture.

1612
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:14,440
No?

1613
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:15,790
All right, look, this
was a bit of fun.

1614
01:16:15,790 --> 01:16:17,373
I just thought it
would be worthwhile.

1615
01:16:17,373 --> 01:16:19,420
Because the only
person in the room

1616
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:21,970
that really knows
who Satoshi Nakamoto

1617
01:16:21,970 --> 01:16:23,380
is isn't going to tell us.

1618
01:16:23,380 --> 01:16:25,750
[LAUGHTER] But you're
welcome back any time.

1619
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:26,400
Thank you.

1620
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:27,550
We'll see you next Tuesday.

1621
01:16:27,550 --> 01:16:32,230
Remember, Larry Lessig is here,
so please do the readings.

1622
01:16:32,230 --> 01:16:35,160
Please, let's have a good time.
