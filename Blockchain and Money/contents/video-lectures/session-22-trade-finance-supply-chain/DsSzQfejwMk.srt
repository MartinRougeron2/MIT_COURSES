8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,350
GARY GENSLER: Today we get to
explore one of the use cases

9
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:31,270
where there's actually a lot of
activity going on in blockchain

10
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:34,210
technology, trade finance.

11
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:37,390
We also have, I
think, at least two

12
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,030
of the groups for final
projects are doing things

13
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,560
on trade finance.

14
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,580
There might be some that
haven't disclosed that to me

15
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,260
or after today
might shift to it.

16
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,450
You never know.

17
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:54,700
And I think 8 or 10
of you actually wrote

18
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,110
your individual pieces today.

19
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:59,020
So it's 15 or 20 of you
that have been spending

20
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,210
a lot of time on trade finance.

21
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:05,650
And I think the reason is that
there's a lot of application

22
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,520
of the underlying technology.

23
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,730
And that's what I'm going
to try to do today and then

24
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,730
hopefully get the help
from the two groups

25
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:22,180
that have some final projects
in this regard and so many

26
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,840
of you that wrote on this today.

27
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,720
I'm going to go through
readings and study

28
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,660
guide, what is trade finance.

29
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:32,920
So we're going to run through.

30
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,462
I'm going to give you a little
sense of what trade finance is

31
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:38,300
from my perspective.

32
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,410
And then we're going to
just go into the blockchain

33
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:43,300
projects themselves.

34
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:46,900
So we'll skip through
these because we're

35
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,940
going to be chatting
about what attributes

36
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,800
that trade finance really has.

37
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,070
Well, Alpha you have a group.

38
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,830
What attributes
is trade finance?

39
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:57,520
What attracted you to this?

40
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,350
AUDIENCE: Multiple
stakeholders that

41
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:03,125
are changing, transferring
data and information.

42
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:04,750
GARY GENSLER: So two
things that I just

43
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:09,160
heard multiple stakeholders
transferring a lot of data.

44
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,580
Anybody else, what other
attributes are there?

45
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,080
AUDIENCE: There's
a lot of paperwork

46
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,500
that is being transferred
between the importer, exporter,

47
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,348
and the banks, issuing
banks and beneficiary banks.

48
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:20,890
GARY GENSLER: So
not only is it data,

49
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,320
but it's still actually
a lot of paperwork.

50
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,820
And actually often times
actual physical paperwork.

51
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,060
There are still
companies, I mean,

52
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,800
they're not as persistent now
as they were years ago called

53
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,880
document couriers
that literally brought

54
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,783
the documents around the globe.

55
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,450
AUDIENCE: You have
different regulations

56
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,790
in different countries.

57
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:47,360
It's hard to see and trust
one central authority

58
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,070
that it's going to give you all
you need done on the charge.

59
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:54,110
GARY GENSLER: So a lot of
different regulatory regimes.

60
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:56,500
But also different countries.

61
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,470
So you have some
information asymmetries.

62
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:04,580
And thus those issues of trust
across those jurisdictions.

63
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,460
AUDIENCE: Along the lines
of the issues of trust,

64
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,945
there's also a lot of
fraud with it as well,

65
00:03:09,945 --> 00:03:13,500
a lot of double spend
and financing issues that

66
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,770
come with this space.

67
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:19,090
GARY GENSLER: So a lot of
fraud and double spend.

68
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,805
Or in trade finance, it
has another term, actually.

69
00:03:21,805 --> 00:03:24,012
Anybody?

70
00:03:24,012 --> 00:03:27,510
It's double financing.

71
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,030
But it's basically the
same conceptual framework

72
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,520
as a double spend.

73
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,420
Can I finance one set of
goods, one cargo being

74
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,540
shipped across the Atlantic or
Pacific, can I fund it twice?

75
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,857
And so that's a
bit of the fraud.

76
00:03:45,857 --> 00:03:47,690
AUDIENCE: And also
because of the high cost,

77
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:50,570
and also all the due diligence,
like small and medium

78
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:53,380
enterprises have a very
hard time getting it,

79
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,130
like because of the
financial crisis

80
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:56,995
and also all the
terrorist attacks.

81
00:03:56,995 --> 00:03:59,120
GARY GENSLER: So do you
think that small and medium

82
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,023
sized enterprises have a
difficulty for the reasons you

83
00:04:02,023 --> 00:04:04,190
just said, because of
terrorist attacks and so forth

84
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:07,100
or is there something more
broadly that's going on,

85
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,520
maybe even for centuries?

86
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,660
New hand here.

87
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:14,450
AUDIENCE: I know it's more of
a problem like small financing

88
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:18,958
that they don't have access to
the find the things they need

89
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,750
that are required,
their business requires,

90
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:21,872
the essential things.

91
00:04:21,872 --> 00:04:24,080
GARY GENSLER: And I can't
tell whether it's a hand up

92
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,934
or you were fixing your hair.

93
00:04:25,934 --> 00:04:26,762
AUDIENCE: Um, both.

94
00:04:26,762 --> 00:04:28,730
GARY GENSLER: Both, OK.

95
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:31,190
AUDIENCE: So I guess
I was going to say,

96
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:34,160
so small businesses often
don't have the resources

97
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,850
administratively to
deal with paperwork.

98
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:41,670
So often the operational burden
becomes so costly for them,

99
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:46,680
that it is no longer actually
profitable for them to trade.

100
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,200
GARY GENSLER: And also small
businesses-- you want to add?

101
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,260
AUDIENCE: They just don't
have a credit history.

102
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:54,290
So banks tend to not
want to finance them.

103
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,217
They just don't trust them.

104
00:04:56,217 --> 00:04:57,050
GARY GENSLER: Right.

105
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,670
AUDIENCE: I just want to
put some numbers to make

106
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,587
it clear to everybody.

107
00:04:59,587 --> 00:05:03,290
I was looking at a study for
the Asian Development Bank

108
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,770
saying that small and
medium sized enterprises are

109
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,210
the most credit constrained.

110
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,760
Around 50% of their
demands are being

111
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:15,560
rejected by banks for
trade finance, whereas 7%

112
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,690
to multinational corporations.

113
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,600
GARY GENSLER: So
this small and medium

114
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,150
sized enterprises
also are smaller.

115
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:24,980
They're not as well known.

116
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:30,220
And trade finance, just by
definition, is cross border.

117
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,880
It's cross jurisdiction,
cross country.

118
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,530
How does somebody in the US
know a small business in Kenya?

119
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:39,620
Or pick your countries--

120
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:42,780
China and Mexico.

121
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,425
So there is a lot of
information challenges.

122
00:05:46,425 --> 00:05:48,800
That's been the history of
this business for a long time.

123
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,410
We'll hold off on
the ongoing projects.

124
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,100
But we'll come back to that.

125
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,130
So we had a bunch of readings.

126
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:03,830
I updated this because
it's ever changing.

127
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,020
And I hope that if
you had a chance

128
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:10,730
to dig in to the Bain review.

129
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:13,860
I thought as these writings
go, it was probably

130
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,110
a little better than some of--

131
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,860
I'm sorry for any of you
going into consultancy, Tom.

132
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,130
But as these things go, I
thought it was better than some

133
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:24,770
of the Deloitte
papers and PwC papers

134
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:27,110
that are still quite helpful.

135
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:31,370
But I thought this was a
little bit more detailed.

136
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:35,160
So what is the background,
the economic background?

137
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,350
This is just from--

138
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,020
I think I pulled this from
some World Bank figures.

139
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:47,600
Worldwide exports of
goods are $17 trillion.

140
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,880
Services are 5 or 6 trillion.

141
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,610
But trade finance is
really around the exporting

142
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,130
of goods more than services.

143
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:59,840
I'm not really familiar with
it in the service context.

144
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,380
And manufacturer's $12 trillion.

145
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,710
Fuels, agriculture,
you can see that.

146
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:11,090
So that's basically
the body of it.

147
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:14,240
And the financing,
international finance--

148
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,730
and I purposely use words.

149
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,400
This is the financing
of international trade.

150
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,590
It can come in two
different ways.

151
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:25,700
One is if the bank is
guaranteeing something

152
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,970
or the bank is supporting
it through the documents.

153
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:33,710
This is the traditional
definition of trade finance.

154
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,820
It is letters of credits
and documentary collection.

155
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,570
Anybody want to tell
me what a letter of--

156
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:41,212
what the difference
of two things are?

157
00:07:41,212 --> 00:07:42,920
Since we've got a
whole bunch of people--

158
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,550
I see a hand up.

159
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:47,970
AUDIENCE: A letter of
credit is a formal letter

160
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:52,020
from a bank just laying out
the terms of credit extended

161
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,540
to let's say the next year.

162
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,910
GARY GENSLER: OK, so it's
a formal letter laying out

163
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,020
the terms.

164
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,130
But critically,
what is it doing?

165
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:02,750
AUDIENCE: Removes
counterparty risk.

166
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,910
Removes the counterparty
risk away from your buyer

167
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:06,423
to the bank.

168
00:08:06,423 --> 00:08:08,340
GARY GENSLER: So it
removes counterparty risk.

169
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,230
It's guaranteeing payment.

170
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,420
But there is a second
form that banks

171
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,625
support this market
in a very big way

172
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:18,670
is documentary collection.

173
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:22,640
Anybody familiar with DCs?

174
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,760
It's basically the
banks are moving

175
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:28,880
the paperwork, this incredible
paperwork around the globe.

176
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,550
And we'll dive into
this a little bit.

177
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:35,450
And they're not-- they're
not taking counterparty risk.

178
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,929
The banks themselves are
not guaranteeing the credit.

179
00:08:38,929 --> 00:08:41,840
But they are performing
enormous services

180
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,820
in terms of the paperwork.

181
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:50,210
And in essence, it's documents
versus performance or documents

182
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:54,530
versus authentication
that goes in.

183
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,820
A bunch of different ways.

184
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:59,030
Factoring and
forfaiting, not that this

185
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,190
is a quiz on these terms.

186
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,810
But these are different terms.

187
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,410
Factoring is when
you sell receivables,

188
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:08,300
short-term receivables.

189
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,970
Forfaiting is when
they're longer term.

190
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:13,670
So they're kind of a
little bit the same thing.

191
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,740
But one is short-term
receivables,

192
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,390
short-term letters of credit.

193
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,580
One are longer term.

194
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,920
You can actually take
import and export loans

195
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,470
out which are longer term.

196
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,720
And they're about a whole
inventory and a whole supply

197
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,750
chain.

198
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,800
You can get financing
beforehand, supplier credit,

199
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,590
and a new form aboard called
supply chain financing

200
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:39,770
where you're really funding
the whole supply chain.

201
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:43,250
But we're going to focus
primarily on the first two.

202
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,430
And most of the blockchain
projects in this space

203
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:50,970
are focusing on the first two.

204
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:55,420
But international trade
also has trade credit.

205
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,800
What's open account?

206
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,300
What does that mean
in any business

207
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,714
when we're here at
Sloan, somebody?

208
00:10:04,612 --> 00:10:06,070
Alean I'm not going
to call on you.

209
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,153
I'm not going to make you.

210
00:10:07,153 --> 00:10:08,010
Jake.

211
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,480
AUDIENCE: Trade is that when
you ship the goods like prior

212
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,550
to payment being due.

213
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,268
GARY GENSLER: So?

214
00:10:12,268 --> 00:10:14,560
AUDIENCE: So you ship goods
prior to payment being due.

215
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,140
GARY GENSLER: All right.

216
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,640
AUDIENCE: The payment is
due like 90 days later.

217
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,400
GARY GENSLER: So it's
due 90 days later.

218
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,620
Open account is what
most businesses do.

219
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,440
If you just say I'm shipping
something, send an invoice.

220
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,540
And the terms might be 2 and 30.

221
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:32,190
You get a 2% discount if you pay
prompt, but 30 days, just open

222
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:32,690
account.

223
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,650
In domestic business that's
how most services are provided

224
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,660
and goods are shipped
is open account.

225
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,720
It's the international
export business

226
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,890
that you find it different.

227
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:50,430
Then cash in advance, of
course, is what it sounds like.

228
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,590
And consignment is
all the other way.

229
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,300
An exporter would actually ship.

230
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,190
You'd put it on your shelves.

231
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,350
You wouldn't have to pay.

232
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:02,800
And the exporter continues
to have the risk of the sale.

233
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,650
Not used a lot in
international trade.

234
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:12,860
You can also get public
guarantees or insurance.

235
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:19,910
So that's the whole world of
these $17 trillion of trade.

236
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,040
Only about 5 or 6
trillion is thought

237
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:27,110
to be actually using
trade credit, letters

238
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:32,300
of credit and
documentary commitments,

239
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,500
these two main things.

240
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,040
So this ranges it.

241
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,650
This gives you a
little bit of a flavor.

242
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:46,510
And this you can think of
is what's the most secure

243
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,730
for the exporter is over here.

244
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:52,240
The exporter is going to
have the most security

245
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,910
if they get cash in advance.

246
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:57,490
But does an importer like that?

247
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:58,030
Not really.

248
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:00,490
An importer really
would rather have

249
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:05,380
consignment, having risk all
the way on the other side.

250
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:08,960
Consignment would say the
exporter takes all the risk.

251
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,630
So it's all about
commercial terms.

252
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,440
But you can think of it
as the other side of this

253
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:20,200
is the least attractive
for the importer is paying

254
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,850
cash in advance.

255
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:26,010
The most attractive to the
exporter is cash in advance.

256
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,680
And every one of these
happens somewhere.

257
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,790
In a $17 trillion market,
$17 trillion of exports,

258
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:38,190
all of this is open
for negotiation.

259
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,425
But think of the exporter
likes this curve.

260
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,070
And the importer likes this.

261
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:53,620
And as I will show in a
second, most of the market

262
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,250
is in the middle.

263
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:56,995
So now trade finance.

264
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:04,207
Exporters, importers, advising
banks, and issuing banks.

265
00:13:04,207 --> 00:13:06,290
And what you're going to
quickly sort of sense is,

266
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:08,690
there's a lot of room maybe
for blockchain technology

267
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:12,530
because there's a
lot of moving parts.

268
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:16,910
By the way, normally if
you work at Wall Street

269
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,740
or at a commercial
bank, you might never

270
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,360
touch trade finance.

271
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,780
It's just like a department that
if you're on a trading floor,

272
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:27,400
you're not really
thinking about a lot.

273
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,500
Who's worked on a
trading floor here?

274
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,240
Did you ever think
about trade finance?

275
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,660
No.

276
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,640
But it's a big market.

277
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,130
It's a very big market.

278
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:42,990
But basically, the exporter and
importer sign a contract that's

279
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:44,878
for the sale of goods.

280
00:13:44,878 --> 00:13:45,545
It could be oil.

281
00:13:45,545 --> 00:13:48,360
It could be agriculture
product or manufacturers.

282
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,870
The importer then arranges
with an issuing bank

283
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,790
a letter of credit.

284
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:57,950
The letter of credit is
sent to the exporter's bank.

285
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:03,630
Sometimes the exporter's bank
puts a second guarantee on it.

286
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:07,290
The exporter's bank might
be actually guaranteeing

287
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:11,410
the importer's bank performance.

288
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:14,830
So there's hundreds of
different arrangements.

289
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:18,190
But the classic thing is
that the importer gets

290
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:21,190
a letter of credit to say,
look, you don't know me,

291
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:28,000
but you can take the risk and
I get this letter of credit.

292
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,200
You exporter will get your money
based upon some documents, when

293
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,660
you put some documents
together and send them to me

294
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:39,640
that you've actually put your
oil or agricultural products

295
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,900
on a ship.

296
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,950
So shipping is a big part of it.

297
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:47,750
The second piece of this is, how
did the documents actually go?

298
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:51,410
The exporter then
ships something.

299
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:54,620
The shipment usually
leads to some documents.

300
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,120
And at the time of
the shipping, you

301
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,380
see number six in this
little box over here

302
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,570
is, the exporter, when
they ship something,

303
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:05,570
also sends some
documents to their bank.

304
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:10,530
Their bank sends it overseas
to the bank in Kenya,

305
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:17,670
let's say, even though that
doesn't have any ports.

306
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,617
Ethiopia, you have ports, right?

307
00:15:19,617 --> 00:15:20,700
AUDIENCE: Kenya has ports.

308
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,890
GARY GENSLER: Kenya
has ports, sorry.

309
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:23,742
You're landlocked.

310
00:15:23,742 --> 00:15:24,450
All right, sorry.

311
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,325
So I've got it right.

312
00:15:25,325 --> 00:15:26,460
So Kenya-- I got it wrong.

313
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,340
But Kenya's got ports.

314
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,560
But the exporter, at the
same time they're shipping,

315
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,200
will also send the documents,
but send the documents

316
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:34,890
to their bank.

317
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,580
Their bank sends it
to the foreign bank.

318
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,790
The foreign bank says, ah-ha.

319
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:41,790
That triggers the condition
in the letter of credit.

320
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,410
Payment will be made.

321
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:48,070
And payment can be made when
you put the goods on the ship.

322
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:51,160
Payment maybe is
made when the goods

323
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,200
get to the foreign country.

324
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,280
All these arrangements
can be different.

325
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,290
So this gives you a
sense of the change.

326
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:08,380
Letter credits were estimated
in 1970 to be about half

327
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,970
of all of trade.

328
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:13,590
Now they're about 15%.

329
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:16,620
World Economic Forum
Bain papers that you all

330
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:22,827
had the pleasure of either
reading or skimming or you'll

331
00:16:22,827 --> 00:16:23,535
read it tomorrow.

332
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:30,360
But letters of credit is
a big piece of the market.

333
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:36,430
Primary open account has
widened as part of the market,

334
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:41,020
I think, in part because
international trade

335
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,270
is probably more dominated
by large companies

336
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,440
now than in the past.

337
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,990
And in the 1970s, even
the large companies

338
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,480
didn't know if they
could trust each other.

339
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,020
The larger enterprises,
larger multinationals

340
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,570
really would prefer just
to trade on open account

341
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:58,710
and extend each
other's credit rather

342
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:03,580
than using the banking system
to guarantee their credit.

343
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:09,869
But trade finance is still
a good call at 15% to 20%,

344
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:14,349
which would still be
rather significant numbers.

345
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:17,520
So that's a little bit
on the sort of questions

346
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,819
about trade finance, how it
fits in, before we start talking

347
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,379
about blockchain projects.

348
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,243
I think I had one other thing.

349
00:17:27,243 --> 00:17:29,160
Here are all the parties
that can be involved.

350
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:36,180
And just to sort
of confuse us all,

351
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,390
here is a list of
some of the documents.

352
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:42,340
And that's not even
a complete list.

353
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,680
I went to a legal
website to find out

354
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:48,640
what all the different
documents you might have.

355
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,350
Anybody know what a
bill of lading is?

356
00:17:53,074 --> 00:17:58,750
AUDIENCE: It's some kind of
receipt from the vessel carrier

357
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:01,450
that is carrying your goods.

358
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,640
And whoever owns
that bill of lading

359
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,470
has the right to
claim the goods.

360
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:07,240
GARY GENSLER: Right.

361
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,800
So it's like a
warehouse receipt.

362
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,440
Remember, we talked about
some of the origins of money

363
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,660
were around warehouse
receipts because I

364
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:18,340
might put my corn or wheat or
gold or bronze in a warehouse.

365
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:23,950
A bill of lading originally,
though the definition is moved

366
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:27,760
on over the centuries, the
original definition it was

367
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,850
like a warehouse
receipt on a ship

368
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:34,930
that you took your products or
goods and placed it on a ship.

369
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:39,820
And you had a bill of lading
because it was on the ship.

370
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:42,570
And you could actually, just
like those original forms

371
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:46,200
of money, warehouse receipts,
you could sell a bill of lading

372
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,570
or discount it and
get money for it.

373
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,700
So bills of lading
have centuries

374
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,000
old, maybe thousands
of years of history,

375
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,670
similar to warehouse receipts.

376
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,630
And in essence, you
might think of a bill

377
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:00,150
of lading a little bit
as a form of money.

378
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,790
But what did I
list just for fun?

379
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:09,845
50 different documents.

380
00:19:09,845 --> 00:19:10,345
Alean.

381
00:19:10,345 --> 00:19:11,520
AUDIENCE: How easy is
it to fake one of these?

382
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,310
GARY GENSLER: Say it louder.

383
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,440
AUDIENCE: How easy is it
to fake one of these bills

384
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,915
and claim someone else's goods?

385
00:19:15,915 --> 00:19:17,290
GARY GENSLER: Very
good question.

386
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,830
So is was a point earlier.

387
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,610
And again, this
goes back centuries

388
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:26,980
that there's been a lot of fraud
around faking a bill of lading

389
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,420
or a bill of exchange,
a warehouse receipt,

390
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:34,750
in another effort.

391
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:38,500
So what you have is you have
a lot of forms of notary,

392
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,740
well before cryptography,
a lot of forms of notary

393
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:48,910
where various transport agents
and shippers had to really

394
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:53,154
have seals and forms of ways
to say this was a committed.

395
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,450
Leonardo.

396
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,380
AUDIENCE: And I think
part of the problem

397
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,150
is that each one single
piece of those documents

398
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,860
are easy to falsify.

399
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,000
That's why this system
became so burdensome

400
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,830
in terms of paperwork,
because they started

401
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:12,620
to build a lot of
steps to guarantee

402
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,300
that you can track all
those things and make sure

403
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,810
you reduce the risk.

404
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:22,310
It's relatively easy to
get one of those faked too.

405
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:25,400
GARY GENSLER: And it's why many
people think this is actually

406
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:32,420
one of the better use cases,
better ecosystems for a revised

407
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,910
technology similar to
blockchain or actually

408
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:38,830
blockchain technology itself,
a lot of multiple parties.

409
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:43,940
And though I only listed seven,
you can have multiple banks.

410
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,640
You can have the importer's
bank, the exporter's bank,

411
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,410
between them you can have a
correspondent bank, right,

412
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:54,970
so at least three banks in the
chain or sometimes even more.

413
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:58,000
Freight forwarders,
shippers, customs

414
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,480
agents in both countries.

415
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,656
You have a question, James?

416
00:21:01,656 --> 00:21:03,280
AUDIENCE: Nope.

417
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,630
GARY GENSLER: So lots of
parties, lots of documents,

418
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:10,040
high chance of fraud.

419
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:12,910
And guaranteeing
validation and verification

420
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:15,340
is a big piece of
this marketplace.

421
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:22,110
So then the question is, can
you put somebody in the middle?

422
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:26,380
See that little blockchain
in the middle, kind of cute.

423
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,670
All right, you're not going
to laugh a little with me.

424
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:34,130
That's the question, so
multiple parties involved.

425
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:36,860
Verification is critical
to all the workflows

426
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:40,250
and the economics.

427
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:43,400
And it relies on
significant document flows.

428
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,380
That's the basic.

429
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:47,690
And it's what--

430
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:49,760
Today's lecture is
really to say well

431
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,160
whether you're looking
at health care records,

432
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,590
whether you're thinking
about commercial real estate,

433
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:59,020
you're thinking about
internet of things,

434
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:02,710
remind yourself of trade
finance because this is probably

435
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,660
one of the best
use cases, at least

436
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:06,870
for permissioned blockchains.

437
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:09,280
So you can debate
whether it could be

438
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,050
done on a traditional database.

439
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:14,350
But it's multiple parties.

440
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,210
Lots of validation
and verification

441
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:20,300
is important, an awful lot
of different documents.

442
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,450
And there there's
property rights involved.

443
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:24,940
Critically, there is
key property rights

444
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,400
because when you're shipping
oil on the high seas

445
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,720
or shipping any bits of that
$17 trillion on the high seas,

446
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:35,040
people want to
finance against it.

447
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,960
AUDIENCE: I have
one question for me

448
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,320
to better understand this.

449
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,240
How do you finance these
from sending a good

450
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,280
from San Francisco to Boston?

451
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,950
And the same time, why?

452
00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:47,110
Is it a matter of that we
need all these documents

453
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:49,027
and we need to put
documents on the blockchain

454
00:22:49,027 --> 00:22:50,930
or can we just get
rid of the documents?

455
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:53,395
Why don't we see the
same thing in intra-US?

456
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,730
GARY GENSLER: Very
good question.

457
00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:00,920
Though the word trade
finance has come to mean,

458
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:06,710
for many decades, maybe hundreds
of years, international trade,

459
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:09,740
the same can be true
for domestic trade,

460
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:12,560
particularly as you're going,
as you said, from San Francisco

461
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,450
to Boston.

462
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:19,060
You could use a letter
of credit between

463
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:23,600
a major domestic manufacturer
and a small business in Boston.

464
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,510
So I might say, I
don't want to take--

465
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:30,770
sorry, Joe Quin, but you're
that small manufacturer.

466
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:33,470
You're that small
entity in Boston.

467
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:36,290
And Tom's not willing to
take your credit risk.

468
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:38,990
You could still want to
have a letter of credit.

469
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,400
It wouldn't be
called technically

470
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,890
a bill of lading if
it's not on a ship,

471
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:45,870
even though that term
sometimes is used.

472
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:51,930
But everything back here could
happen in domestic trade,

473
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,430
but usually doesn't.

474
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:57,240
Most of domestic trade
is done on open account.

475
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:01,060
But some of it's done on
letter of credit especially,

476
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,865
if just small businesses.

477
00:24:02,865 --> 00:24:04,290
Does that help?

478
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:06,120
AUDIENCE: Yes.

479
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,780
I'm trying to think why
do we need it in one case

480
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,013
and not in the other one?

481
00:24:11,013 --> 00:24:12,180
GARY GENSLER: There's more--

482
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,390
I think it's applicable in both.

483
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:17,430
It's more applicable
on international trade

484
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:23,280
because you have more
challenges of trust,

485
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,370
I would even say
information asymmetries.

486
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:31,890
If you're sitting in China
and you're exporting to Kenya,

487
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:35,220
you have less chance to actually
know that local community.

488
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,990
And your bank in China
doesn't know them either.

489
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:44,610
And so what was built up to
satisfy those issues of trust

490
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:46,830
is the banking sector
largely picked up

491
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:50,510
that, either guaranteeing
the documents

492
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:53,220
or actually
guaranteeing the credit.

493
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:53,720
Hugo.

494
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,387
AUDIENCE: There's also something
to say for like border control,

495
00:24:56,387 --> 00:24:56,980
right.

496
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:00,480
Like, I know, in my lab we've
had like waste materials

497
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,760
shipped to us internationally.

498
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:06,450
And customs agents really
even care about that.

499
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:10,480
You have to put a price on
that, even if it has no price.

500
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,440
So like if you could just
put something on a car

501
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,890
and drive it from San
Francisco to Boston,

502
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:17,910
then maybe like, yeah.

503
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,610
If you're driving
from Canada to the US,

504
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:21,570
it would be different
from shipping it

505
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:23,290
from China to the US.

506
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:27,150
But I think the trust
issue comes up a lot more

507
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:30,180
when you're dealing with
international and regulatory

508
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,065
differences between
the two places.

509
00:25:32,065 --> 00:25:33,690
GARY GENSLER: I'm
not saying it doesn't

510
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:35,220
exist in domestic trade.

511
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:38,040
It definitely exists
in domestic trade.

512
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:42,390
But international trade
long ago created a system

513
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:46,960
to address different
languages, different cultures,

514
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,570
different regulatory
regimes, taxing regimes.

515
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:53,040
And it was going on a ship.

516
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,470
AUDIENCE: Even more
anti-money laundering.

517
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,240
So there is other
regulation that

518
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,070
is part of the policy
that complicates it.

519
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,740
One nation, a letter
of credit-- you

520
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,630
need to make sure
that you're not

521
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:08,730
breaking any regulation between
different jurisdictions.

522
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:14,010
Part of it will be ML as
well or ABC or whatever.

523
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:14,990
GARY GENSLER: James.

524
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,100
AUDIENCE: But, I think,
looking at that question,

525
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,380
it seems like we are
using technology,

526
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:23,190
in this case, blockchain
to fit into the existing

527
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,488
framework of how things work.

528
00:26:24,488 --> 00:26:26,030
But shouldn't the
question be flipped

529
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:28,380
to say, hang on a second,
do we need blockchain

530
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,370
in a system that
is better designed,

531
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:32,400
not having 50
different documents,

532
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,030
and actually thinking
about the actual problem.

533
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:38,160
I can see the point
of the trust which

534
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,560
may need a blockchain solution.

535
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,790
But a lot of that--

536
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:44,010
be that trucking receipts,
railroad receipts,

537
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:48,390
or cargo receipts, those
are historical relics.

538
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:50,090
Surely there must
be a technology

539
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:52,927
other than blockchain that
could solve the problem.

540
00:26:52,927 --> 00:26:54,010
GARY GENSLER: Well, maybe.

541
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:56,230
Or maybe blockchain
technology is just

542
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:59,110
the right technology
that's coming along

543
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:03,280
in the 21st century to solve
it better than initially pieces

544
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:08,080
of paper and literally
document couriers that

545
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,932
had to be trusted to do it.

546
00:27:09,932 --> 00:27:11,890
AUDIENCE: They've gone
the way the dodo, right?

547
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:12,973
So--

548
00:27:12,973 --> 00:27:15,640
GARY GENSLER: Well, they haven't
fully gone the way of the dodo.

549
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,440
AUDIENCE: While I
think that there's

550
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,220
much to be said about blockchain
that creates trust in parties

551
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:24,913
that may not naturally
trust each other,

552
00:27:24,913 --> 00:27:27,580
the problem seems to me is there
is a lot of things that doesn't

553
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,490
need to happen in this day
and age, as you mentioned,

554
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,420
domestic mail services.

555
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,480
It's between sender
and receiver.

556
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,070
What happens in between is
tracked by UPS or whoever.

557
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:42,390
But what we certainly don't see
is all of that list of stuff

558
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:43,390
while this is happening.

559
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:47,340
But it's unnecessary,
domestically,

560
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,200
GARY GENSLER: You
might be right.

561
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,020
But what's happened well before
blockchain technology came

562
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:54,720
along is digitization.

563
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,230
But part of the trade
can't be dematerialized.

564
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:00,660
See in the securities
business, what

565
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:03,120
we talked about when we talked
about clearing and settling

566
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,150
of securities, the
equity ownership

567
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,710
has been dematerialized.

568
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:10,660
And it started to
happen in the 1970s.

569
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:15,150
The legal right that
you have this cash flow

570
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:21,600
called an equity interest
in Apple is all digitized.

571
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,990
Part of this trade is not
digitized, $17 trillion

572
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:30,020
of physical goods
on the high seas.

573
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,300
So I still think you're
going to need something

574
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:37,490
that shows that the physical
goods made it on a ship

575
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:40,500
or on a cargo
vessel of some sort.

576
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,050
And so there are
some differences.

577
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:43,818
Erik.

578
00:28:43,818 --> 00:28:44,860
Still haven't heard from.

579
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,220
AUDIENCE: Yes.

580
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:50,320
Just to address a
concern of James

581
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:55,460
that many of the manual
plus the station projects

582
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:59,020
fail at the beginning because
they actually did that.

583
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:02,450
They kind of tried to
reflect exactly what happened

584
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:07,160
in the manual world into the
digitized world, which resulted

585
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,860
in many inefficiencies.

586
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:12,090
And this is not the case.

587
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:17,690
We're not actually trying to do
exactly that off line process

588
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:18,935
using blockchain technology.

589
00:29:18,935 --> 00:29:20,060
That's not the alternative.

590
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:25,820
But that actually made me think
that I wanted to point out this

591
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:29,510
to your argumentative of
centralized databases.

592
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:31,430
And centralized databases
have been around

593
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:32,940
for more than 60 years.

594
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,300
They've been digitizing
manual processes for a while.

595
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:39,300
The question comes is, why
didn't they already digitize

596
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,490
these sort of problems?

597
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:45,860
The answer is because
this trade finance issue

598
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:50,000
has special characteristics
that make it especially

599
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,460
suitable for it to be addressed
by these specific technologies.

600
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,760
So that's why I
would argue that.

601
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,600
GARY GENSLER: And what do you
think that specialness is?

602
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,050
AUDIENCE: It's
precisely the fact

603
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:03,710
that you have multiple
stakeholders dealing

604
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:09,140
with information that goes
among all of these moving parts

605
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,940
and you have a
high cost of trust.

606
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:15,710
So what you're actually doing
is using blockchain technology

607
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:18,680
permissioned or
otherwise to address

608
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:22,015
this specific challenge.

609
00:30:22,015 --> 00:30:24,140
GARY GENSLER: And you have
a property right as well

610
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:27,290
that people often want to
borrow still against while it's

611
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,750
on the high seas.

612
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:33,770
But I agree it may well be that
the blockchain technology is

613
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:36,470
not the only solution to this.

614
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:42,050
But it does feel like it's
a particularly fertile area.

615
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:44,630
And we're going to turn right
now to some of the projects.

616
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:48,000
And there is a lot of
projects in this space.

617
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,500
Alean.

618
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,315
And then we'll go
in back to Aviva.

619
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:54,710
AUDIENCE: So is the overarching
goal here to fix the fraud

620
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:57,292
or to fix the complexity,
what's the goal?

621
00:30:57,292 --> 00:30:59,250
GARY GENSLER: Well it's
a really good question.

622
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,550
So those working
on projects, is it

623
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:04,440
more about fraud
or the complexity?

624
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,963
AUDIENCE: Fraud.

625
00:31:05,963 --> 00:31:07,130
GARY GENSLER: So efficiency.

626
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:08,672
AUDIENCE: Yes, the
complexity I guess

627
00:31:08,672 --> 00:31:10,400
is a function of the fact.

628
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,870
GARY GENSLER: So you can you
can drive a lot of efficiency,

629
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:16,670
which is due to the complexity.

630
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:19,610
I think, that's one of
the overarching goals

631
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:27,760
is driving efficiency, but also
to lower the fraud or the loss

632
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,970
to fraud.

633
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:29,570
It's both.

634
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:31,580
But I think it's driven
more by the efficiency

635
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,360
from my readings of this.

636
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,885
AUDIENCE: Fraud.

637
00:31:34,885 --> 00:31:36,510
GARY GENSLER: More
by the efficiencies.

638
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:38,030
AUDIENCE: What's the fraud rate?

639
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,780
GARY GENSLER: I don't
know the fraud rate.

640
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,820
That's a good question.

641
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:45,135
We'll see if we can find it
out Aviva was going to be next.

642
00:31:45,135 --> 00:31:47,510
AUDIENCE: So let's say that
trade finance does transition

643
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:50,200
to a blockchain
and then that it's

644
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,560
more in the private blockchain.

645
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:57,338
So then how do we solve the
problem of interoperability?

646
00:31:57,338 --> 00:31:59,130
GARY GENSLER: Can I
hold that, because it's

647
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:00,713
a very good question
that will come up

648
00:32:00,713 --> 00:32:03,260
when we talk a little bit
about some of the IBM projects,

649
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,840
particularly with one
of the largest shippers?

650
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,590
So it's the right question.

651
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,997
But we're going to chat
about when we talk about it.

652
00:32:09,997 --> 00:32:12,080
Can I talk about some of
the projects or was there

653
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,920
something?

654
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,410
So where are we?

655
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:19,290
Well, there's five
big consortium.

656
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:21,630
Two of them you can
see are backed on--

657
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:23,310
or working on the Corda.

658
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:28,020
That was R3 Corda that we talked
about earlier this semester.

659
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,120
Two are on IBM.

660
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:34,020
One that's on a
Ping An Group, we

661
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:36,690
didn't talk about
earlier this year.

662
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:42,300
So letter of credit approach.

663
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,247
Receivables and payment
guarantee financing, which

664
00:32:45,247 --> 00:32:46,330
is a little bit different.

665
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:48,030
This is, we already
have receivables,

666
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:48,960
how do we fund them?

667
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:55,870
Monitoring open transactions
and letters of credit.

668
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:59,610
And then the Hong Kong group is
a supply chain record keeping.

669
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:04,260
And just if you want to
see it sort of visually,

670
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,420
this is all the banks
that are involved

671
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:09,430
in each of the consortium.

672
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:14,190
And you'll see basically that
there's some overlap, I think,

673
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:16,530
unless I'm mistaken.

674
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:18,450
I and G might be in
a couple of them.

675
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:21,480
I think two of these consortia
maybe have now merged.

676
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:25,920
But it goes a little bit.

677
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,680
It's not fully going to
answer your question of Aviva.

678
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,590
But even if there were five
different consortium trying

679
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:35,750
to figure this out amongst
different groups of banks,

680
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:38,210
at some point in time to
really gain a great deal

681
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:42,530
more efficiency, how do they
operate, how do they transact

682
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:47,000
across their platforms?

683
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,120
Now they each, obviously, don't
want to give up economic rents.

684
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:54,203
They don't want to give up
market power to somebody.

685
00:33:54,203 --> 00:33:55,620
They don't want
to all of a sudden

686
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:58,680
find out that some
entrepreneur is charging them

687
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:04,380
so much because they created
a network, because the one

688
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:10,170
consortium that figures this
out early on could price pretty

689
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:14,760
close to their cost structure,
but later on could, you know,

690
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,520
price a lot higher and
collect a lot of monopoly

691
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,489
or economic rents.

692
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:22,583
So I don't know where
this will sort out.

693
00:34:22,583 --> 00:34:24,000
And I don't even
know that they're

694
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,290
going to want to solve the
interoperability problem

695
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:29,530
amongst themselves.

696
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:30,250
Sean.

697
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:33,989
AUDIENCE: One interesting kind
of finding fault with consortia

698
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:36,630
is all of the banks
listed up there,

699
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,670
all these are Asian
bank or European bank.

700
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,830
None of the US banks are
actually participating.

701
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:44,130
I see US Bank, so one.

702
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:46,860
GARY GENSLER: But do
you see JP Morgan Chase?

703
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:59,190
Now, who's the largest issuer
of trade finance in the world?

704
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,570
AUDIENCE: US Government?

705
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:01,170
GARY GENSLER: What's that?

706
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:02,590
AUDIENCE: It's not the
US Government, is it?

707
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,632
GARY GENSLER: No, no, no.

708
00:35:03,632 --> 00:35:04,450
I think it's--

709
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:07,430
I think it's HSBC.

710
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:08,640
I might be mistaken.

711
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,900
AUDIENCE: I think it's HSBC.

712
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,567
GARY GENSLER: You
think too, it is HSBC.

713
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,550
But you're right.

714
00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:21,530
The five big-- Wells Fargo
is not on there either.

715
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:24,030
Now that doesn't mean they're
not working on other projects,

716
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:26,140
because here here's
some other projects.

717
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,870
And these aren't the consortia.

718
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:29,280
I'm just giving us flavor.

719
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,530
There's a lot going
on in this space.

720
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:34,500
And those of you who are
doing final projects,

721
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,640
I challenge you to think
about these projects.

722
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,650
And say, well what are you
recommending that's different,

723
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:42,150
you know.

724
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:46,072
It's not just me too, me
too financial, not the other

725
00:35:46,072 --> 00:35:46,820
me too stuff.

726
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:53,430
India's interesting to me.

727
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:58,530
There's another consortium
that wasn't on that page.

728
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:01,620
And I'll probably
pronounce it wrong.

729
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,390
"Final Cal" or "Finic Cal."

730
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,140
AUDIENCE: Finacle.

731
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:05,223
GARY GENSLER: What's that?

732
00:36:05,223 --> 00:36:06,570
AUDIENCE: Finacle.

733
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:08,490
GARY GENSLER: Are you
familiar with that?

734
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:10,040
AUDIENCE: Not much, I just
know the pronunciation.

735
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,582
GARY GENSLER: Just
the pronunciation.

736
00:36:11,582 --> 00:36:12,840
Thank you for helping me out.

737
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,170
I needed it.

738
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:16,790
For validation
documents and payment,

739
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:19,290
so they're not really saying
we're just trade finance.

740
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:22,020
But we're going to validate all
the documents This goes more

741
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,300
to fraud.

742
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:26,880
I think this project, validating
the documents, saying,

743
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,920
yes, they're true
and good, and you can

744
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,440
lend against these documents.

745
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,150
And a lot of times
these documents

746
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:35,250
are the bills of
lading and bills

747
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:39,760
of exchange or loan
lendable and so forth.

748
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,700
So a lot of projects, one--

749
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,780
I could only find and
there may be others,

750
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,910
I could only find
one with a token.

751
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:49,660
And I put it up
there last, Ethereum

752
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:53,640
based ConsenSys,
the company that's

753
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:57,930
run by Joe Lubin who is the
Canadian venture capitalist who

754
00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:03,570
helped back Vitalik
Buterin and Ethereum.

755
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:06,330
ConsenSys has 300 or
400 people at least

756
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:10,230
working in ConsenSys doing
Ethereum based projects.

757
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:14,010
So I was pleased to see I could
find one native based token.

758
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:19,050
But to my knowledge, all of the
consortia and all of the ones

759
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:22,320
I listed up there are
permissioned blockchains

760
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,910
from what I can tell.

761
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:27,010
But I'm curious, those of
you who are working on this,

762
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:31,740
have you found any native
token projects here?

763
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:34,110
AUDIENCE: There
is still b-verify,

764
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:37,170
which is a project
from the Media Lab.

765
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:39,910
It doesn't have a
native token per se,

766
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:42,510
but uses permissionless
blockchain,

767
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,510
existing permissionless
blockchain infrastructure

768
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:53,040
to gain the readability
of lots of statements

769
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:58,200
to build a warehouse
receipts use case.

770
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,680
So they are using transactions
in the Bitcoin network

771
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,190
right now to write--

772
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:07,650
GARY GENSLER: But does
b-verify have a token?

773
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:08,522
AUDIENCE: No.

774
00:38:08,522 --> 00:38:09,480
GARY GENSLER: No token.

775
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,855
AUDIENCE: It's
been restructured.

776
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:11,510
Yeah.

777
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,097
Yeah.

778
00:38:12,097 --> 00:38:13,430
GARY GENSLER: What's that Alean?

779
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:17,065
AUDIENCE: I think they build on
top of our research from Cecil.

780
00:38:17,065 --> 00:38:17,940
GARY GENSLER: Catina?

781
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:18,560
AUDIENCE: Yes.

782
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:19,060
Exactly.

783
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,620
Yeah.

784
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:23,340
Catina is a person.

785
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:24,970
GARY GENSLER: So is
that your research?

786
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:25,260
AUDIENCE: That's right.

787
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:25,690
Yeah.

788
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:26,940
GARY GENSLER: That's terrific.

789
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:31,470
But you're-- you're-- so
you're going to talk to Eric.

790
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:33,300
But you didn't have
a token in that.

791
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,300
AUDIENCE: No, you
don't need a token.

792
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,258
That's the whole point.

793
00:38:35,258 --> 00:38:36,570
Like Bitcoin is out there.

794
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:37,650
It's a great system.

795
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:40,600
And you can build on
top of it efficiently,

796
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:44,250
providing mutability to
any permissioned app.

797
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:46,743
So don't start it as a
contract necessarily,

798
00:38:46,743 --> 00:38:48,910
unless, I don't know, maybe
there's a need for that.

799
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,368
But in a lot of
things there's not,

800
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:52,820
like digital
identity, for example.

801
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,620
That can be very conservative.

802
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,370
GARY GENSLER: But if
you put a token in it

803
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:58,230
and sold it right
into this bull market,

804
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:01,130
I guess you wouldn't be
sitting in this class.

805
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,296
AUDIENCE: Well, yeah.

806
00:39:02,296 --> 00:39:05,420
[LAUGHTER]

807
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:08,500
GARY GENSLER: But I mean, I'm
glad you didn't put a token.

808
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,722
I'm glad you're here.

809
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,680
But I mean that's part
of-- like you're saying,

810
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:16,240
you didn't need it as a
technological and commercial

811
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,920
point is what you're saying.

812
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,800
Leonardo.

813
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,680
AUDIENCE: I was just
going to mention,

814
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,637
I happen to know a couple of
people working on this project.

815
00:39:24,637 --> 00:39:25,970
GARY GENSLER: Which one of them?

816
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:27,080
AUDIENCE: The last one.

817
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,540
GARY GENSLER: Could you
tell us something about it?

818
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:31,550
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so I had to dig
a little bit into the native

819
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:33,080
talking that you mentioned.

820
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,780
But most of the
trading firms there

821
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:42,440
are petroleum based, so like
very large shippers of oil.

822
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:46,160
Back to your point, bill of
lading, in the commodity space,

823
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,830
the petroleum bill of lading
are the ones that most actively

824
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:50,330
traded.

825
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:53,987
And they change hands very often
while the vessel is at sea.

826
00:39:53,987 --> 00:39:56,570
GARY GENSLER: Actually if I can
add to this, because I learned

827
00:39:56,570 --> 00:40:00,290
a little bit about this when I
was in the US Commodity Futures

828
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:01,790
Trading Commission.

829
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:06,260
The bill of lading for
oil on the high seas

830
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:09,260
can trade hands hundreds
if not thousands of times.

831
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:16,850
The oil coming from the
Strait of Hormuz to Houston

832
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:18,930
might change ownership in--

833
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:22,445
I don't know how long it
takes a 15 or 30 day trip.

834
00:40:22,445 --> 00:40:23,603
AUDIENCE: About 20 days.

835
00:40:23,603 --> 00:40:24,770
GARY GENSLER: A 20 day trip.

836
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:28,790
It can change the ownership
hundreds of times.

837
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:33,410
So those documents
become tradable goods.

838
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:34,800
And it's not just in theory.

839
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,393
It's very much in practice.

840
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,810
AUDIENCE: So the
point I was going

841
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:42,170
to make is I suspect they
may be talking there must be

842
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:46,680
some kind of collateralization
against those,

843
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:52,690
you know, the bill of
lading from the company.

844
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:55,290
GARY GENSLER: So Alpha, who
I'm sure I remember everybody

845
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:56,940
in your group, what
can you tell us

846
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,770
about what you're working on?

847
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:01,250
How are you going to
beat all these consortia?

848
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,440
I'm thinking, you know,
your final project is going

849
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,847
to do better than these, right?

850
00:41:04,847 --> 00:41:05,680
AUDIENCE: Of course.

851
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,120
[LAUGHTER]

852
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,870
We're taking the--

853
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:12,210
GARY GENSLER: I did give these
two groups the heads up that I

854
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:13,377
was going to I call on them.

855
00:41:13,377 --> 00:41:15,342
So this is not just-- but yeah.

856
00:41:15,342 --> 00:41:16,800
AUDIENCE: We're
taking the approach

857
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,420
of just being very specific.

858
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,440
So we're focusing
on a narrow corridor

859
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:24,360
between Chinese exports
coming into Ethiopia.

860
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,600
And so one there aren't
many people, obviously,

861
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,660
looking at that space,
at least not yet.

862
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,910
GARY GENSLER: And is it
through the trade finance side

863
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:35,140
or what I'll call the
supply chain side?

864
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,705
AUDIENCE: The
trade finance side.

865
00:41:36,705 --> 00:41:38,580
And so we think it's
particularly interesting

866
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,330
around not just
Ethiopia, but all

867
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:42,540
of the sort of developing
countries in that region,

868
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:46,250
because credit and finance
is already so limited.

869
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:49,518
And so the domestic banking
systems are undeveloped.

870
00:41:49,518 --> 00:41:51,060
GARY GENSLER: Domestic
banking system

871
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,133
in Ethiopia particularly?

872
00:41:52,133 --> 00:41:55,200
AUDIENCE: Right, and across
East Africa, I would say.

873
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,860
And so the reliance on trade
finance in those import

874
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:01,060
heavy economies, I
think, is even higher.

875
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,690
So the ping point, I think,
is even stronger there.

876
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:04,320
GARY GENSLER:
James, did you have

877
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,445
a question for their group?

878
00:42:05,445 --> 00:42:09,260
Anybody that has questions
for the group, pile in.

879
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,500
They'll take the advice.

880
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,958
AUDIENCE: Not
specific on this one,

881
00:42:11,958 --> 00:42:13,220
but more of a clarification.

882
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:17,322
So I can clearly see that
trade finance requires

883
00:42:17,322 --> 00:42:18,780
different parties
and the ownership

884
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:22,620
of the goods at any point
in time in the supply chain

885
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,870
is important, but--

886
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:27,240
GARY GENSLER: Particularly
when it becomes commoditized,

887
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,710
like oil and so forth.

888
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:31,590
AUDIENCE: But from
like over time--

889
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,390
a lot of the times
I hear about people

890
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:36,720
saying blockchain
using, in this scenario,

891
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,000
there's a supply chain.

892
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,070
Given that they're not
really exchanging it

893
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:44,970
for money, are there actually
any commercial cases or use

894
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:48,170
cases with genuine useful
points about supply chain

895
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:49,170
being on the blockchain?

896
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:51,600
I mean, tracing where
my coffee bean came

897
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,450
from on the blockchain
is pretty useless to me.

898
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:57,088
But people seem to think
about it as a great thing.

899
00:42:57,088 --> 00:42:58,880
I can trace back where
something came from.

900
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,740
GARY GENSLER: Are
you a coffee drinker?

901
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:01,410
AUDIENCE: Yes.

902
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:01,920
Yes.

903
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,010
Not because of your class.

904
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:03,180
GARY GENSLER: No.

905
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:03,330
No.

906
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,260
I just didn't know.

907
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:08,587
You could drink tea to
stay awake in my class too.

908
00:43:08,587 --> 00:43:10,170
AUDIENCE: But I just
didn't understand

909
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,020
when people keep talking
about supply chain needing

910
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,020
to be on the blockchain.

911
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:15,410
I just don't understand why.

912
00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:17,250
Where's there is trade
finance, absolutely.

913
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:18,750
GARY GENSLER: All
right, your solved

914
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:21,240
is-- wait before
everybody piles in.

915
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:26,010
Does anybody have advice for
China Ethiopia trade finance?

916
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:27,510
I'm going to give
everybody a chance

917
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:29,130
to pile into James's question.

918
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:32,995
But you're in a China
Ethiopia trade finance.

919
00:43:32,995 --> 00:43:35,370
AUDIENCE: Yes, I have a question
of the interoperability.

920
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:39,990
I mean, what's the solution for
the Ethiopian purchasers, just

921
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:42,720
have to basically buy
into whatever system

922
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,200
these firms are using?

923
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,610
So Ethiopian firms have
to use letters of credit.

924
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:51,180
So that's a regulation.

925
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,910
So everything is done
completely manualized right now.

926
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:57,000
So we would offer just something
very, very sort of specific

927
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,690
like an eBill of lading
or an eInvoice platform.

928
00:44:01,690 --> 00:44:03,556
It could be on a smartphone.

929
00:44:03,556 --> 00:44:05,190
My Impression is
that it'd be easier

930
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:08,090
to get the Ethiopian
firms to buy into this,

931
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:11,640
whereas the Chinese firms
may have multiple options

932
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:12,690
or multiple systems.

933
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:17,280
So how would you approach
getting them onto your system

934
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,980
specifically or
being able to utilize

935
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:22,675
your system using websites or
whatever else they are using?

936
00:44:22,675 --> 00:44:23,550
So yeah, so we agree.

937
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:26,640
So you'd have to get just
Ethiopian businesses and banks

938
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,960
on the system.

939
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,810
And so they would be sort
of our initial customers.

940
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:32,400
And for any Chinese
bank that wants

941
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,942
to do business to
export to Ethiopia,

942
00:44:33,942 --> 00:44:35,850
they have to go
through Ethiopian Bank.

943
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:38,040
So inevitably, they'd
have to go through this.

944
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:38,850
GARY GENSLER: So it
sounds like you're

945
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:40,440
trying to build a solution.

946
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,840
Your adoption is through
the importer side,

947
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:45,400
through the Ethiopian
side initially.

948
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,490
And then the Chinese
exporters would say,

949
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:50,040
well this is how I get
into the Ethiopian market

950
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:53,130
in a more secure, maybe more
efficient, but certainly more

951
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:54,090
secure way.

952
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:57,940
Other thoughts on this project?

953
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:01,170
AUDIENCE: I thought I saw
there was a new consortium that

954
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:05,280
was predominantly Chinese
shippers and container

955
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,215
companies.

956
00:45:06,215 --> 00:45:07,590
It wasn't on that
particular one.

957
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:08,450
GARY GENSLER: And it's not this.

958
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:09,930
It's not the first
one, The People's--

959
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:11,097
AUDIENCE: Not the first one.

960
00:45:11,097 --> 00:45:14,530
No, this one has a couple of
Chinese shipping companies.

961
00:45:14,530 --> 00:45:15,750
It's very new.

962
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:19,450
It's like November 8th or 9th or
something that it was launched.

963
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:21,030
So it's just getting started.

964
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:22,320
They were looking for vendors.

965
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,905
And yeah, it's a
huge consortia there.

966
00:45:23,905 --> 00:45:24,780
GARY GENSLER: No, no.

967
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:28,930
This is one of the most active
and it's remained active,

968
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:32,560
but mostly permissioned
blockchain chain technology.

969
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,210
It's the most active
and very vibrant.

970
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:39,060
And if you had to say
probability weighted,

971
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:41,340
there'll be something
successful in this space more

972
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:46,530
than maybe some of
the other spaces.

973
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:50,130
So who wants to chime
into James' supply chain--

974
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:51,120
this unit?

975
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,120
You're going to jump in.

976
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,450
So I just want to
tell-- here's just two

977
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:55,980
example of some shipping.

978
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:58,170
And I just pulled up
five quick examples

979
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:00,450
of supply chain projects.

980
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:03,880
But Eric, you want to
address James coffee?

981
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,580
You like coffee more than James.

982
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,580
AUDIENCE: I won't give
you an example of coffee,

983
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:10,300
but let's say fruits.

984
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:13,200
You have a big
retailer chain that--

985
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,470
and I think the
example is in Britain.

986
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:19,260
Suddenly you have reports
of sudden infection

987
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,350
of E coli in a specific fruit.

988
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:27,570
OK, so as a responsible measure,
the retailer have to hold off--

989
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:32,420
actually has to know which
part or which load of fruit is

990
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:34,110
the one affected.

991
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:37,040
So since the whole
process of, you know,

992
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,680
digging through a huge file
of paperwork takes weeks.

993
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:44,190
These guys would have to
hold off a big bunch of fruit

994
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:46,620
that they would
eventually get lost

995
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:50,590
with the economic
implications of that.

996
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:51,190
That was a--

997
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:52,103
They probably--

998
00:46:52,103 --> 00:46:53,270
GARY GENSLER: So wait, wait.

999
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:53,830
So let's see.

1000
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:55,080
AUDIENCE: We're getting there.

1001
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,930
We're getting there.

1002
00:46:56,930 --> 00:47:00,600
So having your
supply chain connect

1003
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:05,210
to a blockchain, that
can allow you quickly

1004
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:09,897
get the information within
hours and immediately identify

1005
00:47:09,897 --> 00:47:11,480
which is the load
that's been affected

1006
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:15,460
and take it out with the
decreased economic costs.

1007
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:17,790
GARY GENSLER: So you got
at least three other hands.

1008
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:19,350
We'll go--

1009
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:21,020
AUDIENCE: So I tend
to agree with James.

1010
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:24,245
So what I've heard
critiques of using

1011
00:47:24,245 --> 00:47:25,620
both blockchain
for supply chains

1012
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:29,220
for things like blood diamonds
or preventing counterfeit goods

1013
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:30,060
or whatever.

1014
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:33,360
Diamonds we have
DeBeers project.

1015
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,530
Yeah, so I know these
guys are doing that.

1016
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:36,730
But the criticism.

1017
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:40,385
I've heard is that because these
aren't digital native goods,

1018
00:47:40,385 --> 00:47:42,510
there has to be an interface
between the real world

1019
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:43,680
and the blockchain.

1020
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,120
GARY GENSLER: Physical
good to the digital good.

1021
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,010
AUDIENCE: And what
I've heard from critics

1022
00:47:47,010 --> 00:47:50,010
is that it's at
the point of origin

1023
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:52,937
that fraud or counterfeiting
whatever takes place.

1024
00:47:52,937 --> 00:47:55,062
And it's the point of
origin, where that data needs

1025
00:47:55,062 --> 00:47:56,550
to take place anyway.

1026
00:47:56,550 --> 00:47:58,080
So it's garbage in garbage out.

1027
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,720
You can put a
counterfeit thing in,

1028
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,100
but then that passes
through the supply chain.

1029
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:05,683
GARY GENSLER: We have
Shammon, Raheem, and then Tom.

1030
00:48:05,683 --> 00:48:07,350
AUDIENCE: I'm going
to pick James' side.

1031
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:09,017
GARY GENSLER: Oh my
god, I need somebody

1032
00:48:09,017 --> 00:48:10,860
on the other side of James.

1033
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:13,062
AUDIENCE: Maybe you
can help me in a sense

1034
00:48:13,062 --> 00:48:15,270
that like Walmart, right,
is kind of a prime example.

1035
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:16,980
They've implemented, et cetera.

1036
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:19,920
But basically if Walmart
just said like, so

1037
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,380
basically they're using
IBM infrastructure, right.

1038
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:25,230
If they went to the supply
chain said, look guys,

1039
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:27,510
we hired IBM, OK.

1040
00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:28,860
Now you're going to send--

1041
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:31,510
every time this good
can transfer hands,

1042
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:33,510
you're going to to send
that information to IBM.

1043
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:33,840
That's it.

1044
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,923
I mean basically that's
what happened because it's

1045
00:48:35,923 --> 00:48:37,920
being stored on a
server that IBM--

1046
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,247
like what is blockchain about?

1047
00:48:41,247 --> 00:48:42,080
GARY GENSLER: Well--

1048
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,390
AUDIENCE: Like I heard them
how this is blockchain.

1049
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:49,170
But I really don't see what
is blockchain about it.

1050
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:49,920
I mean basically--

1051
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,795
GARY GENSLER: So who
wants to take-- who want

1052
00:48:51,795 --> 00:48:53,100
to take the other side for him?

1053
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:53,850
And I know, James.

1054
00:48:53,850 --> 00:48:55,920
You're not taking the
other side of James.

1055
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,900
AUDIENCE: I think is
a bit controversial.

1056
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:00,820
But when I was in the UK
a couple of years ago,

1057
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:02,280
there were some
activists talking

1058
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:05,280
about the origin of
weapons and some areas

1059
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,790
where weapons were being
smuggled in some war zones.

1060
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:10,620
The point of origin
in this case will

1061
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:15,990
be the developed world, which
is going into the US, UK, China.

1062
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:20,850
If you can trace the origin of
the weapons sent in war zones,

1063
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:25,980
you could know how did it end
up there and you can stop maybe.

1064
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:26,760
I don't know.

1065
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,950
You need to trust the data
entry in the first place.

1066
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:30,100
GARY GENSLER: You
do have to have--

1067
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,058
AUDIENCE: But the point
of origin in this case,

1068
00:49:32,058 --> 00:49:34,930
is not trusted.

1069
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:38,620
It would be trusted because
it would be manufacturers.

1070
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:40,287
And most of the
manufacturing would be--

1071
00:49:40,287 --> 00:49:42,828
GARY GENSLER: I'm going to hold
off because I want to get Tom

1072
00:49:42,828 --> 00:49:44,770
and then I'm going to
give you a reply, James.

1073
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:45,270
Tom.

1074
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:47,640
AUDIENCE: Yes, so I
am on the other side.

1075
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:48,717
I think it works.

1076
00:49:48,717 --> 00:49:51,050
And it sort of goes back to
Alean's original question of

1077
00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:53,850
whether or not this is about
addressing fraud or addressing

1078
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:55,540
the efficiency of the system.

1079
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:57,530
The data entry is the same.

1080
00:49:57,530 --> 00:50:00,140
I mean, if the data
entry from a paper system

1081
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:04,860
or a non-block digital system
or a blockchain system is bad,

1082
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:07,080
then it's always
going to be bad.

1083
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:10,430
But if it's good, it's as good
as it is right now and probably

1084
00:50:10,430 --> 00:50:12,560
as good as it's going
to be short of like RFID

1085
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:15,150
chipping every
individual product,

1086
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:17,900
then what it does is allow
that same record to go

1087
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:19,760
through the entire supply chain.

1088
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:23,630
So what is deemed by
whatever data input

1089
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:28,780
system to be a conflict free
diamond is seen by DeBeers,

1090
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:33,860
the exporter, the producer, the
porch, the ultimate importer

1091
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:34,370
of the good.

1092
00:50:34,370 --> 00:50:39,470
And so you can save what are
now verification costs in terms

1093
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:43,760
of time by processing
a railway receipt,

1094
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,310
a trucking receipt, a shipping
receipt, forwarding exchange

1095
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:50,480
receipt by making that
same document viewable

1096
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,810
and immutable to all of
the partners in the trade.

1097
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:55,610
GARY GENSLER: And to
Shammon's question,

1098
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:58,430
I think you've framed
the right question.

1099
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:01,550
Basically, well, why not just
the traditional database?

1100
00:51:01,550 --> 00:51:06,770
IBM is the software provider
of Hyperledger Fabric.

1101
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:09,020
Why not just give the
information to IBM?

1102
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:11,510
And in fact, maybe that's
what Walmart is doing,

1103
00:51:11,510 --> 00:51:12,218
is what you said.

1104
00:51:12,218 --> 00:51:13,843
AUDIENCE: That's why
I said what I did.

1105
00:51:13,843 --> 00:51:15,800
GARY GENSLER: Now I
haven't dug deeply enough.

1106
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:18,425
And often when you dig into
these websites and the news

1107
00:51:18,425 --> 00:51:20,300
articles and the white
papers you can't quite

1108
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:23,150
tell how they're using IBM.

1109
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:26,360
IBM, I think, has 1,500
people in their division

1110
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,460
that does Hyperledger projects.

1111
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,900
So they they're out there.

1112
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:33,350
IBM is marketing this.

1113
00:51:33,350 --> 00:51:35,540
But I think the theory
at least, because I'm not

1114
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:39,290
going to be able to answer
what Walmart's really doing.

1115
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:43,430
The theory is it's more
censorship resistant,

1116
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:46,330
that the data is actually
shared on multiple nodes

1117
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:48,080
even if it's permissioned,
even if there's

1118
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:54,640
only 15 or 20 nodes
or 30 nodes, that it's

1119
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,010
more censorship resistant
than if it's all

1120
00:51:57,010 --> 00:51:59,080
stored on an IBM server.

1121
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:02,260
And I don't know the answer,
whether the Walmart is actually

1122
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:05,200
stored on 30 different nodes.

1123
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:09,430
But if it were,
then arguably then,

1124
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:12,250
even though it's
permissioned and private,

1125
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:17,560
it's more censorship resistant
and you can have more assurance

1126
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:18,850
around this.

1127
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:19,840
One of the challenges--

1128
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:23,740
Aviva left the room, on
interoperability is this number

1129
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:25,330
two, TradeLens.

1130
00:52:25,330 --> 00:52:31,390
TradeLens, the IBM and
"Marks," "Merks," how

1131
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:32,990
do you pronounce that company?

1132
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:33,880
AUDIENCE: Maersk.

1133
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:34,300
GARY GENSLER: Maersk.

1134
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:35,200
It's one of the largest--

1135
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,492
it's one of the two or three
largest shipping companies

1136
00:52:37,492 --> 00:52:38,930
in the entire world.

1137
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:41,570
They come up with a project.

1138
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:43,190
They announce it, tout it.

1139
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:45,350
It's over a year and a half ago.

1140
00:52:45,350 --> 00:52:48,020
There's no adoption
because the other shipping

1141
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:49,970
companies are
saying, why do I want

1142
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:53,740
to adopt something with you?

1143
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:58,540
Now it would be one thing if
some neutral standard setter,

1144
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:01,810
almost like in the internet
the I Can or something.

1145
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:06,940
But some neutral standard setter
came up with a consortium.

1146
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:09,070
But all the other
shippers in the world

1147
00:53:09,070 --> 00:53:14,420
say, I don't want to give up to
Maersk my data, my information,

1148
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:17,540
and what might be
also market power.

1149
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:21,260
So interoperability
works there as well.

1150
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:24,350
All right, James
wants to have a reply.

1151
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:26,365
But are you all
right holding off?

1152
00:53:26,365 --> 00:53:26,990
AUDIENCE: Sure.

1153
00:53:26,990 --> 00:53:27,990
GARY GENSLER: All right.

1154
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:29,880
So we'll take two from my right.

1155
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,010
AUDIENCE: I think there's
another issue which

1156
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:32,677
is more about the
economics of it, which

1157
00:53:32,677 --> 00:53:35,280
is, OK, let's say
that Walmart adopts,

1158
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,615
like basically right now they
can force a lot of the supply

1159
00:53:38,615 --> 00:53:39,470
chain to adopt this.

1160
00:53:39,470 --> 00:53:42,313
I think there's a real
question about what they're

1161
00:53:42,313 --> 00:53:43,730
going to do with
that data, right,

1162
00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:46,670
because essentially what it
does it allows them access

1163
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:47,900
to the end producer.

1164
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:52,530
So the production of mangoes
is very fragmented, right.

1165
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:53,780
But then you get consolidated.

1166
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:57,110
So there are multiple
steps along the chain

1167
00:53:57,110 --> 00:53:59,570
that actually extract economic
value, not the growers.

1168
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,370
I mean, they're kind
of screwed, right.

1169
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:05,960
But now Walmart can go
directly to the growers,

1170
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:09,750
because now they have access to
the data of who the grower is,

1171
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:12,560
what their productivity is,
and how much they produce

1172
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:15,020
or what time of the year
they produce, et cetera.

1173
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:17,630
Well, there's a question
about whether they

1174
00:54:17,630 --> 00:54:20,810
want to cooperate with that
or how much information I

1175
00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:22,790
want to share with that
if I'm in the middle

1176
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:25,190
and I'm actually accepting
economic rent right now.

1177
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:28,510
GARY GENSLER: Right, so if the
whole supply chain is somehow--

1178
00:54:28,510 --> 00:54:30,538
AUDIENCE: It's not just
the administration.

1179
00:54:30,538 --> 00:54:32,330
GARY GENSLER: Yeah,
that's right, the data.

1180
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:36,330
Just like Facebook collects
data or Visa collects EMI

1181
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:39,940
data, that maybe Walmart
would collect data.

1182
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:42,440
AUDIENCE: My question takes the
Walmart example a little bit

1183
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:42,940
further.

1184
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:44,900
I'm curious to
understand do you put

1185
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:47,040
a supplier early
on in the process,

1186
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,610
say a farmer or something
selling to Walmart,

1187
00:54:49,610 --> 00:54:53,090
do they even have exposure in
terms of the user experience

1188
00:54:53,090 --> 00:54:56,210
that they are on blockchain
or does this just

1189
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:57,740
become the back end.

1190
00:54:57,740 --> 00:54:59,550
I guess, I understand
what we've talked

1191
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:01,490
in terms of private keys
for digital currency.

1192
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:03,530
I'm trying to connect how that
ties to the user experience

1193
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:04,030
here.

1194
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:06,450
They have like scanners
that they basically

1195
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:09,520
scan or it's their phones
or whatever, right.

1196
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:12,890
So you have third parties
using these linkages.

1197
00:55:12,890 --> 00:55:18,523
They don't know basically
where this data is going.

1198
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:19,690
GARY GENSLER: So I'm honest.

1199
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:22,410
I'm going to take Shammon's
description of it.

1200
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:24,680
I'm not as close to the Walmart.

1201
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:27,800
I think in the trade
finance side, the consortium

1202
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:34,820
that these and these, the
importer, the exporter,

1203
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:40,100
the banks, the shippers,
and the best of these

1204
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:44,060
are meant to have a lot of
involvement and exposure,

1205
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:51,060
because even though this looks
pretty complicated and it is,

1206
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:52,460
they're large institutions.

1207
00:55:52,460 --> 00:55:53,090
They're banks.

1208
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:53,870
They're shippers.

1209
00:55:53,870 --> 00:55:57,080
They're freight forwarders,
except for maybe

1210
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:00,740
the small and medium sized
enterprises in Ethiopia.

1211
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:04,860
But then they're an importer
that needs to have involvement.

1212
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:07,850
I think on the supply
chain side, the Walmart,

1213
00:56:07,850 --> 00:56:10,520
an individual grower
of mango, you're

1214
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:14,020
saying from your understanding
Walmart's not looking for them.

1215
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:17,212
AUDIENCE: Again, this is because
they're very proud of that.

1216
00:56:17,212 --> 00:56:19,670
They're proud of the fact that
they can actually influence.

1217
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:23,970
The reason why is because
they have the last mile.

1218
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:25,987
It is very simple.

1219
00:56:25,987 --> 00:56:28,070
GARY GENSLER: But they
would have to have some way

1220
00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:29,090
to do what Tom said.

1221
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:33,290
They have to be able to
put into digital form

1222
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:35,825
the physical asset, the mangoes
are from this pack farm.

1223
00:56:35,825 --> 00:56:36,450
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1224
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:38,140
But they can use a cell phone.

1225
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:40,740
You know, so you type in,
OK, so you know like--

1226
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:41,700
GARY GENSLER: A scan.

1227
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:42,325
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1228
00:56:42,325 --> 00:56:45,020
GARY GENSLER: A QR
code or something.

1229
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:46,322
James, you want to reply?

1230
00:56:46,322 --> 00:56:47,780
And then we'll go
back to you here.

1231
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:48,530
AUDIENCE: Just quick points.

1232
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:49,160
I think--

1233
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:50,880
GARY GENSLER: Are
you convinced yet?

1234
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,742
AUDIENCE: No.

1235
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:54,200
I think ultimately
there's no doubt

1236
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,900
that once the digital
record's created,

1237
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:58,160
the digital immutability,
whether it's

1238
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:04,310
a blockchain or a very secure
standard traditional database,

1239
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:05,910
they are going to be the same.

1240
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:08,000
The digital records, it's fine.

1241
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,190
But in the fiscal
world in the context

1242
00:57:10,190 --> 00:57:14,120
of supply chain, whether
it's from the origin

1243
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:17,420
or any other individuals
along the chain, all it takes

1244
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:20,410
is one bad actor to do
something to the physical good.

1245
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:23,510
But while traditional
record is immutable,

1246
00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:27,240
you're link between the physical
and digital is not guaranteed.

1247
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:32,570
So I still don't see how
a physical commodity can

1248
00:57:32,570 --> 00:57:35,420
be guaranteed to go from one
end to the other of the supply

1249
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:39,520
chain without ever being
tampered or altered.

1250
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:43,628
That is still a big
question for me.

1251
00:57:43,628 --> 00:57:44,420
GARY GENSLER: Hugo.

1252
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:45,560
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I was
going to say that.

1253
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,540
I don't know if
that's the objective.

1254
00:57:47,540 --> 00:57:51,045
Because if you take diamonds,
right, and as long as you--

1255
00:57:51,045 --> 00:57:53,420
like what people care about
when they're buying a diamond

1256
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:55,480
is just the margin, right.

1257
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:58,400
But my point is that it doesn't
stop anyone along the supply

1258
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,120
chain to have--

1259
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:02,840
It just makes it more expensive.

1260
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:03,667
But, but--

1261
00:58:03,667 --> 00:58:05,750
GARY GENSLER: Seriously,
I think you're holding it

1262
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:07,790
up to too high of a standard.

1263
00:58:07,790 --> 00:58:11,960
Because even the oil, let's go
back, not diamonds, but oil.

1264
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:16,430
For quite some time you
could have a bill of lading

1265
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:17,400
and then sell it.

1266
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,700
And as I mentioned
earlier for the 20 days

1267
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:23,180
that things are coming from
the Mideast to Houston,

1268
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:27,060
that might transact
20 times, 100 times

1269
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:29,710
today in 2018 markets.

1270
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:32,660
And nobody is actually looking
to see whether the oil has

1271
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:36,680
been somehow siphoned off the
ship and it's no longer there.

1272
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:40,970
So there are aspects of
trust that would still

1273
00:58:40,970 --> 00:58:47,170
be in the system with somebody
certifying when the ship is--

1274
00:58:47,170 --> 00:58:49,700
I don't remember the
word, but on board,

1275
00:58:49,700 --> 00:58:53,060
when the oil is put on the
ship and when it comes off.

1276
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:56,720
And there's validations
at those moments

1277
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:00,060
that would then communicate
to the digital records.

1278
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:01,310
AUDIENCE: But I guess that's--

1279
00:59:01,310 --> 00:59:03,110
GARY GENSLER: Then you could
do that through inspections

1280
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:03,640
of diamonds.

1281
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,390
I don't think you're
going to change that.

1282
00:59:05,390 --> 00:59:07,640
I think that's still
going to be important.

1283
00:59:07,640 --> 00:59:10,490
But what you can do is
Alean's earlier point,

1284
00:59:10,490 --> 00:59:12,830
you can lower a lot of the cost.

1285
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:16,380
You can drive a
lot of efficiency.

1286
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:20,215
And you can probably lower the
fraud around the documents.

1287
00:59:20,215 --> 00:59:20,840
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1288
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:22,190
So I guess my point--

1289
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:24,130
one of my-- I guess
what I'm saying is--

1290
00:59:24,130 --> 00:59:24,950
GARY GENSLER: And then
we're going to move on.

1291
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:27,158
AUDIENCE: If the trust isn't
there in the first place

1292
00:59:27,158 --> 00:59:30,050
or you have to rely on some
other trust, what exactly

1293
00:59:30,050 --> 00:59:31,970
is blockchain adding in
terms of the physical,

1294
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:34,140
the digital records?

1295
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:36,140
That's what I'm finding
difficult to understand.

1296
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:38,690
But I think I'll finish
up with a quick point.

1297
00:59:38,690 --> 00:59:41,030
I spoke to someone at the
conference from ExxonMobil,

1298
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:43,030
since we're talking oil.

1299
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:45,530
And he does a supply chain and
implementation of blockchain.

1300
00:59:45,530 --> 00:59:49,650
And I challenged him, why not
use a standardized database?

1301
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:52,370
And he said, well, it's because
if you're going to get everyone

1302
00:59:52,370 --> 00:59:55,760
along the chain to
upgrade to a new system,

1303
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,178
it's far easier by telling
them, oh, it's blockchain,

1304
00:59:58,178 --> 01:00:00,720
rather than saying, well, I have
this sophisticated database.

1305
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,512
GARY GENSLER: I'm going
to hold that point.

1306
01:00:02,512 --> 01:00:03,890
I'm agreeing with that point.

1307
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:05,545
But we had Dan and Jay.

1308
01:00:05,545 --> 01:00:06,170
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1309
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:07,700
I just want to
say, I mean, I fell

1310
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:11,210
like this is way more
feasible for a smaller

1311
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:16,180
kind of vertically
integrated supply chains,

1312
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:17,750
where like for
DeBeers where like

1313
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:19,950
they own every kind of
step in the process.

1314
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:21,950
And therefore, you kind of--

1315
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:26,210
can really trust and trace
the flow of the product.

1316
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:30,440
But something for like
groceries where you have,

1317
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,670
kind of, farmers
all over the world

1318
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:35,580
and, you know, there's
seasonality, right, changing.

1319
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:39,650
So there's just so many
smaller shops that I can't ever

1320
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:42,950
see it being feasible for them
to adopt kind of a high level

1321
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:45,590
technology.

1322
01:00:45,590 --> 01:00:47,720
GARY GENSLER: You
may well be right,

1323
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:51,800
though QR codes have
been adopted in millions

1324
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:55,520
of retail establishments,
when 20 years ago it was kind

1325
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,710
of like, what's this all about?

1326
01:00:57,710 --> 01:00:59,030
In fact 30 years ago--

1327
01:01:01,853 --> 01:01:03,770
he's in the news because
he just passed away--

1328
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:07,510
but President George
Herbert Walker Bush,

1329
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:09,050
some people say
part of the reason

1330
01:01:09,050 --> 01:01:12,080
he lost the election
in 1992 was that he

1331
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:15,270
didn't know what a scanner
was in a grocery store.

1332
01:01:15,270 --> 01:01:17,090
And he was president
of the United States.

1333
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:17,965
Can you imagine that?

1334
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:21,560
But he didn't because
he grew up in an era

1335
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:23,990
and it was happening while
he was in the White House.

1336
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:28,400
And now you couldn't imagine
not knowing what a scanner is.

1337
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:30,590
So I agree with you.

1338
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:35,200
But what's happening in 20 years
is sometimes hard to predict.

1339
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,670
AUDIENCE: Yes to build
on that a little bit, I

1340
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:39,555
think if you are
completely vertical,

1341
01:01:39,555 --> 01:01:41,930
then you don't really need
blockchain in the first place,

1342
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:43,998
because you have
your own database.

1343
01:01:43,998 --> 01:01:46,040
Your tracking everything
as it goes through that.

1344
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,540
The reason you need block chain
is for the traceability when

1345
01:01:48,540 --> 01:01:50,090
you have 20 different parties.

1346
01:01:50,090 --> 01:01:53,690
But also once you
digitalized this whole thing,

1347
01:01:53,690 --> 01:01:57,440
I mean, right now it's all
paperwork, so you bring it--

1348
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:58,940
digitalization is
going to allow you

1349
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:00,920
to use other tools like IoT.

1350
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:02,120
So you can maybe use--

1351
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:04,610
to take the diamond
example, use computer vision

1352
01:02:04,610 --> 01:02:07,100
to actually tell that you have
the exact diamond that you

1353
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:09,920
started with at the end
of the supply chain.

1354
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,560
Or with food, that you can test
the texture of food and things

1355
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:13,280
like that.

1356
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:14,697
So it's all about
quality as well.

1357
01:02:14,697 --> 01:02:16,363
GARY GENSLER: By the
way, you can hash--

1358
01:02:16,363 --> 01:02:18,980
you remember that stuff, that
broccoli at the beginning?

1359
01:02:18,980 --> 01:02:20,960
You can use
cryptographic hashes also

1360
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:24,560
to take pictures, to take
other data about the diamond,

1361
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:26,650
other data about the foods.

1362
01:02:26,650 --> 01:02:29,540
AUDIENCE: I'm just going to add,
especially with the diamonds,

1363
01:02:29,540 --> 01:02:32,342
I got kind of razzed after
reading the article because we

1364
01:02:32,342 --> 01:02:33,050
all know DeBeers.

1365
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:36,420
They're like the best
marketers out in the world.

1366
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:37,940
They convinced every
woman that they

1367
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:39,230
need a diamond in their life.

1368
01:02:39,230 --> 01:02:42,380
They invented the concept of
like a diamond engagement ring.

1369
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:45,290
So I think like this is
the perfect marketing ploy

1370
01:02:45,290 --> 01:02:49,670
to say they needed to blockchain
for diamonds, like the entire--

1371
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:53,780
like DeBeers is the
entire diamond industry

1372
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:56,420
and how they now receive
diamonds is already

1373
01:02:56,420 --> 01:02:58,280
completely regulated.

1374
01:02:58,280 --> 01:02:59,780
But with regard
of about in house

1375
01:02:59,780 --> 01:03:03,440
and controlled by them
because of the backlash

1376
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,150
against like conflict--

1377
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:09,830
diamonds from conflict-- or
conflict originated diamonds.

1378
01:03:09,830 --> 01:03:13,250
So for me, it just seems
like a big marketing scheme

1379
01:03:13,250 --> 01:03:17,220
that they already feel like
they have this under control.

1380
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:20,840
But in order to like buy
more consumer confidence,

1381
01:03:20,840 --> 01:03:23,590
they're using it.

1382
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:27,170
GARY GENSLER: I think you land
upon a point about marketing.

1383
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:29,840
And James has said it earlier,
and a little bit of others

1384
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:31,520
in short.

1385
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,470
Oil executives, says,
well, it's the only way

1386
01:03:33,470 --> 01:03:38,110
I'm going to get broad adoption
is if I call this blockchain.

1387
01:03:38,110 --> 01:03:40,770
And that might be true even of
the Australian stock exchange,

1388
01:03:40,770 --> 01:03:45,210
even though I think there's
a real use case there.

1389
01:03:45,210 --> 01:03:47,080
But it's about adoption.

1390
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:49,270
Now DeBeers might be
doing it because they

1391
01:03:49,270 --> 01:03:50,710
want to sell more diamonds.

1392
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:52,390
The oil executive
might be doing it

1393
01:03:52,390 --> 01:03:54,760
because he just wants to
get rid of a legacy system.

1394
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,500
Or the Australian
stock exchange might

1395
01:03:56,500 --> 01:04:00,850
say, this is the only way I can
get investment in getting rid

1396
01:04:00,850 --> 01:04:03,040
of a legacy system,
because I can

1397
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:05,680
either scare my
board of directors

1398
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,810
and say we have to
do blockchain or I

1399
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:10,060
can inspire my
board of directors

1400
01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:12,370
by saying I have
to use blockchain.

1401
01:04:12,370 --> 01:04:14,560
But nonetheless,
blockchain technology

1402
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:16,580
will have some adoption.

1403
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:18,900
And I think it will
have more adoption,

1404
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:20,860
so it's more ripe for adoption.

1405
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:22,840
And I'm going to
turn to this again.

1406
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:24,430
You know where I'm going.

1407
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:27,710
It's like, yep, yep, you
know, cost and benefits.

1408
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:30,340
These are-- I'm doing this
as a favor for all of you

1409
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:32,920
too because, you're all
writing your final projects.

1410
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:35,310
But it's really about--

1411
01:04:35,310 --> 01:04:38,500
it's going to be where there's
multiple parties involved

1412
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:42,070
in data and that data
represents some property

1413
01:04:42,070 --> 01:04:45,560
right, either money.

1414
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:47,740
In a dematerialized
way, it's easier

1415
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:51,520
to envision that's money
versus security, money

1416
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:54,190
versus something dematerialized.

1417
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:57,070
It's a little harder as we've
done today on the supply chain,

1418
01:04:57,070 --> 01:05:00,440
when it's against
a physical asset.

1419
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:04,120
But if there's multiple parties
and where verification matters,

1420
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:06,850
verification costs,
you can probably

1421
01:05:06,850 --> 01:05:10,720
drive some efficiency with a
blockchain technology solution.

1422
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:12,310
Good question Shammon raises.

1423
01:05:12,310 --> 01:05:13,685
Well, wait a
minute, maybe you're

1424
01:05:13,685 --> 01:05:16,390
just shipping the data to IBM.

1425
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:18,130
Are you really
shipping it to just--

1426
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:20,920
that's called a traditional
database, a distributed

1427
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:21,430
database.

1428
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:25,270
Or do you get something out
of censorship resistance?

1429
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:30,370
And if it's truly shared in
20, 30, 50, or 100 places,

1430
01:05:30,370 --> 01:05:32,980
do you lower, as the Australian
stock exchange really

1431
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:36,370
does believe they'll do, lower
reconciliation costs, which

1432
01:05:36,370 --> 01:05:39,002
is, again, a way to
drive efficiency.

1433
01:05:39,002 --> 01:05:40,585
But I can't remember
the number, there

1434
01:05:40,585 --> 01:05:47,410
are 77 member companies can
all have a shared ledger

1435
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:50,530
and then lower the
cost of reconciliation.

1436
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:52,210
It's still what
somewhat controlled.

1437
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:55,405
Those 77, it's not a public
blockchain like Bitcoin.

1438
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:02,160
So whether it's the two
groups that are here today

1439
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:03,420
that are doing trade finance.

1440
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:05,878
And you have a harder challenge,
by the way, because you've

1441
01:06:05,878 --> 01:06:09,910
got to go beyond this lecture.

1442
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:12,670
Alpha's is going, yeah, sure.

1443
01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:16,860
But if you're doing
commercial or consumer finance

1444
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:19,130
or real estate or
whatever, and there

1445
01:06:19,130 --> 01:06:21,500
are some really interesting
projects amongst you,

1446
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:24,060
just thinking about
where is that value add?

1447
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:28,110
What verification and networking
costs are going to be lowered?

1448
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:30,060
What's the competition doing?

1449
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:33,180
Figure out if there's any
consortium doing whatever

1450
01:06:33,180 --> 01:06:35,470
you're proposing to do.

1451
01:06:35,470 --> 01:06:38,220
Or is there any of the
3,000 to 5,000 white papers,

1452
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:41,380
was there any ICO token?

1453
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:43,750
And then if you want to
do a slap down and say

1454
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:46,900
why what they're doing is
foolish and doesn't work

1455
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:48,280
and you're doing
something better

1456
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:51,370
or you just want to learn,
just please don't plagiarize.

1457
01:06:51,370 --> 01:06:56,470
But just look at what the
competition's doing as well.

1458
01:06:56,470 --> 01:07:01,300
And why is an append only log,
you know, the right way to go?

1459
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:02,120
Alean.

1460
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:05,700
AUDIENCE: What about
competitors who are incumbents?

1461
01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:06,940
GARY GENSLER: Absolutely.

1462
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:09,910
So you're still doing the
mortgage product, right?

1463
01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:11,950
I don't know if you changed.

1464
01:07:11,950 --> 01:07:14,260
Yeah, what's happening
in the mortgage market?

1465
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:15,970
How is it being--

1466
01:07:15,970 --> 01:07:20,170
whether it's securitized
or underwritten

1467
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:24,110
and whether it's traditional
database management.

1468
01:07:24,110 --> 01:07:26,200
But it's also an
interesting to know

1469
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:29,080
if anyone else is trying to
look at either permissioned or

1470
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:34,460
permissionless systems and
where you fit in to that,

1471
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:36,200
because you're actually
trying to raise

1472
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:37,520
money on this, if I remember.

1473
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:38,310
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1474
01:07:38,310 --> 01:07:39,620
GARY GENSLER: Yeah, so
to the extent that you're

1475
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:41,590
going to raise money,
those venture capitalists

1476
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:44,690
are going to be asking tougher
questions than I'll ever

1477
01:07:44,690 --> 01:07:48,310
be asking, at least I hope.

1478
01:07:48,310 --> 01:07:49,750
AUDIENCE: I honestly don't.

1479
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:50,580
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

1480
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:51,080
Yeah.

1481
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:51,735
I got it.

1482
01:07:51,735 --> 01:07:52,610
You want cheap money.

1483
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:54,260
You want me to be the toughie.

1484
01:07:54,260 --> 01:07:54,760
Yeah.

1485
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:56,540
All right.

1486
01:07:56,540 --> 01:07:59,480
And what are the trade-offs?

1487
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:01,200
I'm not asking any
of you to have solved

1488
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:02,723
scalability and performance.

1489
01:08:02,723 --> 01:08:04,640
Some of the scalability
and performance issues

1490
01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:06,930
won't be solved
for 5 to 10 years.

1491
01:08:06,930 --> 01:08:08,200
But at least note them.

1492
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,250
At least say, hey,
this won't work

1493
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:14,120
until this is solved
or something like that.

1494
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:17,930
Thursday we're going
to do identity.

1495
01:08:17,930 --> 01:08:20,776
I can't remember, is anybody
doing projects on identity?

1496
01:08:25,350 --> 01:08:26,359
You're together, right?

1497
01:08:26,359 --> 01:08:26,859
Yeah.

1498
01:08:26,859 --> 01:08:27,819
All right.

1499
01:08:27,819 --> 01:08:32,470
Be ready to chat on Thursday
and share where you are.

1500
01:08:32,470 --> 01:08:36,500
Kelly's looking like you're
going to be sick on Thursday.

1501
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,319
You'll be here.

1502
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:41,050
And how many of you are
going to get your MIT

1503
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:43,399
diploma on a blockchain?

1504
01:08:43,399 --> 01:08:44,660
AUDIENCE: You have option?

1505
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:46,600
GARY GENSLER: Yes.

1506
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:49,106
AUDIENCE: Do we get an
option of not getting one?

1507
01:08:49,106 --> 01:08:49,843
I don't think so.

1508
01:08:49,843 --> 01:08:51,885
GARY GENSLER: Oh, you mean
you think you have to.

1509
01:08:51,885 --> 01:08:53,385
AUDIENCE: I think
it's done for you.

1510
01:08:53,385 --> 01:08:54,890
GARY GENSLER: Oh,
it's done for you.

1511
01:08:54,890 --> 01:08:56,729
All right, there you go.

1512
01:08:56,729 --> 01:08:57,520
What's that?

1513
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:00,689
You excited by that?

1514
01:09:00,689 --> 01:09:04,569
Do you think you can
finance off of it though?

1515
01:09:04,569 --> 01:09:08,260
So trade finance, $17 trillion.

1516
01:09:08,260 --> 01:09:12,729
It's a very significant
role that in financing

1517
01:09:12,729 --> 01:09:19,490
this $17 trillion of trade,
lots of people involved,

1518
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:22,189
sort of ripe for
blockchain technology,

1519
01:09:22,189 --> 01:09:26,810
a lot of consortiums
and projects underway.

1520
01:09:26,810 --> 01:09:29,330
But they're almost all
permissioned systems

1521
01:09:29,330 --> 01:09:33,140
with a couple of exceptions.

1522
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:35,420
But it feels like it's
a catalyst for change.

1523
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:37,700
I think that even
if it's just simply

1524
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:41,229
because it's the
way to get adoption.

1525
01:09:41,229 --> 01:09:43,870
And I'm talking
about trade finance.

1526
01:09:43,870 --> 01:09:47,920
And then there's this related
part of the supply chain

1527
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:50,080
management and so forth.

1528
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:52,120
Any other questions or
are we breaking early?

1529
01:09:52,120 --> 01:09:53,130
AUDIENCE: Early.

1530
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:57,040
GARY GENSLER: Do
