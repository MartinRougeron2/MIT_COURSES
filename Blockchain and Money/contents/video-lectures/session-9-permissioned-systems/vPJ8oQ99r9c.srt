8
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,050
PROFESSOR: Welcome back.

9
00:00:26,954 --> 00:00:30,970
I know we're sort of getting
into the middle of the week.

10
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,610
Some of you maybe want to
keep your laptops open to work

11
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:35,890
on other courses'
midterms, but I

12
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:38,940
will ask you to try to focus
on Blockchain and Money today.

13
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,610
Today, we're going to
chat about permissioned

14
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,762
versus permissionless systems.

15
00:00:48,762 --> 00:00:49,470
I want to thank--

16
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:51,060
I have a guest here.

17
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,740
I call out guest when
they're here and I know them.

18
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:59,060
Mark Snyderman, who runs
a fund at Fidelity--

19
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,110
Mark runs a 6--
about $6 billion?

20
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:05,725
Called the Real Estate
Income Fund at Fidelity.

21
00:01:05,725 --> 00:01:07,100
And you might say,
well, why does

22
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,725
he want to come to a
Blockchain and Money course?

23
00:01:09,725 --> 00:01:11,600
It's because we went to
high school together.

24
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,320
[LAUGHTER]

25
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:19,490
So-- and I was at his wedding.

26
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:23,120
And he's getting
married again next week.

27
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:23,620
Yeah.

28
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:27,050
[APPLAUSE]

29
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:32,750
But you can all inundate
Mark later about Fidelity,

30
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:35,560
because he's been there
for a lot of years.

31
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,510
See what I'm going to do?

32
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:42,650
I'm shamelessly for
MIT and MIT students.

33
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,790
So let's get going.

34
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:48,380
I was letting a little bit
of time for a few more people

35
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,820
to wander in.

36
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,120
Today, we're going to talk--

37
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,960
of course, we're going to chat
a little bit about the readings

38
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,610
and study questions.

39
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,200
Going to go back
again to, what are

40
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,430
the technical and
commercial challenges?

41
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,100
And this is relative--

42
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,770
this is relevant for
all of our lectures,

43
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,780
but it's particularly
relevant today,

44
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,479
because we're going to
be talking about two

45
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,820
different database structures.

46
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,490
One's the permissionless
blockchain of Bitcoin.

47
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:17,370
But now, today, we're going
to introduce and go deeper

48
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,330
into the permissioned, or
private, set of blockchains,

49
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,920
like the IBM
Hyperledger and Corda.

50
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,163
But the technical issues
relate to all of that.

51
00:02:30,163 --> 00:02:31,830
And then, of course,
we're going to talk

52
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:36,090
about that against a
third type of database--

53
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,680
traditional databases.

54
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,520
So aligning permissionless,
like Bitcoin, permissioned--

55
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,130
IBM Hyperledger type of--

56
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:49,760
and then traditional databases,
and why, in a business setting,

57
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,300
you might think of one versus
another versus another.

58
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,060
And I'm sure if I run
off the rails anywhere

59
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:59,370
on traditional databases, which
I have not personally studied,

60
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,480
Alon will help bail
me out somewhere.

61
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,950
Is that a deal?

62
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:04,450
Maybe?

63
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:04,755
AUDIENCE: OK.

64
00:03:04,755 --> 00:03:05,630
PROFESSOR: All right.

65
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,653
[LAUGHTER]

66
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,070
AUDIENCE: You asked for it.

67
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,070
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I asked for it.

68
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:13,640
Mark, Alon is a
computer scientists

69
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,720
from other parts of MIT, so
he helps me out in subjects

70
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,900
I don't know, and even in
subjects I think I know.

71
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,700
So let's just start a
little bit with what did you

72
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,717
take from the readings?

73
00:03:29,717 --> 00:03:31,550
There were four or five
readings, of course.

74
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:35,810
But what is a permissioned or
private distributed ledger?

75
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:37,080
Now, I can do this.

76
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,590
I can light them up, as some
people said, because Toledo's

77
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,940
given me my list.

78
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:47,540
But again, class participation--
anybody who hasn't spoken yet

79
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:51,930
might want to sort of chime
in and give it a shot.

80
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,195
I'm not seeing any volunteers.

81
00:03:53,195 --> 00:03:55,560
If I can-- ooh, yes.

82
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,790
Do you want to tell me
your first name again?

83
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:58,880
AUDIENCE: Jayati

84
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,710
PROFESSOR: Jayati.

85
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,520
AUDIENCE: Jayati.

86
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,980
PROFESSOR: OK.

87
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,480
AUDIENCE: So the
permissioned DODs,

88
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,520
unlike the permissioned
[INAUDIBLE] Bitcoin,

89
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,880
they limit the number
of participants.

90
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,770
Essentially, they
require the participants

91
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:18,079
to be authorized
before they can enter

92
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,110
into this sort of technology.

93
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:25,640
And in addition to that, they
are said to be stakeholders.

94
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,350
And since they are
the only ones involved

95
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,860
in verifying the transaction--

96
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,540
unlike the permissionless
ones, where

97
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,270
it has to be verified
at all the nodes,

98
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:39,680
this limits the
permissions required

99
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,230
[INAUDIBLE] stakeholders,
which increases,

100
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,630
also, the transaction speed.

101
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:48,320
So it's like the
triangular dilemma

102
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,770
we learned about, about the
security and decentralization

103
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,200
and scalability.

104
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,690
So it moves away
from decentralization

105
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:57,937
and towards scalability.

106
00:04:57,937 --> 00:04:58,520
PROFESSOR: OK.

107
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,112
So Jayeta--

108
00:05:02,112 --> 00:05:03,360
AUDIENCE: Jayehta.

109
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,230
PROFESSOR: Jayeta went
through a whole lot.

110
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,950
It's about the number of
nodes and permissioned

111
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,950
into it, and that
it addresses some

112
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:17,820
of that Buterin's trilemma.

113
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,720
So at its core, it
sort of addresses

114
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,890
some of the scalability issues.

115
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:26,460
But it does that at a trade
off that it's not truly open.

116
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,370
It's not, anyone can
write to the ledger.

117
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,630
I mean, that's sort of
the fundamental things.

118
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:35,910
Anything else that folks
took out of the core readings

119
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:39,750
as to how it separates
and how it's different?

120
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,480
I mean-- all right.

121
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,640
We'll get a chance
to add a little bit.

122
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,790
And then we're going to dive
into Hyperledger and Corda

123
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,670
a bit.

124
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,460
We'll talk about
Digital Asset Holdings.

125
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:54,750
What's Digital Asset Holdings?

126
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,535
Anybody know this company?

127
00:05:59,145 --> 00:06:00,380
Alon knows it.

128
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,320
Brotish knows it.

129
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,592
Eilon.

130
00:06:03,592 --> 00:06:05,364
So Eilon.

131
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:08,207
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

132
00:06:08,207 --> 00:06:10,040
It's basically a
competitor of [INAUDIBLE]..

133
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,890
They're trying to build
a DLT protocol that

134
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:15,590
will allow financial
institutions to exchange

135
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,180
information and value.

136
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,280
And they started,
to my understanding,

137
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,480
in 2016, which is two
years after R3 Corda funded

138
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,310
by [INAUDIBLE]
JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs.

139
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,170
They're basically the same
amount of money-- $110 million.

140
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:33,860
PROFESSOR: And who,
other than Alon

141
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,350
can tell me who runs
Digital Asset Holdings?

142
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,262
Just, it shows that
you did the reading.

143
00:06:39,262 --> 00:06:40,820
Somebody out there.

144
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,320
Yes.

145
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:41,820
Priya?

146
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,600
AUDIENCE: It was--

147
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:42,840
AUDIENCE: Priya.

148
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,710
AUDIENCE: Yes.

149
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,920
Blythe Mas-- Blythe
Masters, or Blythe--

150
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,090
PROFESSOR: Blythe Masters.

151
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:47,360
AUDIENCE: Yes.

152
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,235
PROFESSOR: All right.

153
00:06:48,235 --> 00:06:50,930
Does anybody know
who Blythe Masters is

154
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:54,250
and what she's famous for
beyond Digital Asset Holdings?

155
00:06:54,250 --> 00:07:00,740
AUDIENCE: She worked at
JPMorgan, and she [INAUDIBLE]

156
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,360
credit default swaps.

157
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,310
PROFESSOR: So she
worked at JPMorgan,

158
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:08,310
and she's known around the
world of credit default swaps.

159
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,900
Gillian Tett, who some of you--

160
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,590
the Sloan Fellows
will get a chance

161
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:16,010
to chat with Gillian Tett
in New York in a few weeks.

162
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:20,240
Gillian Tett wrote a whole
book about credit default swaps

163
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,340
and JPMorgan.

164
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,080
And Blythe Masters is
a central character

165
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,770
in that whole narrative art.

166
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,600
And this is what
she's doing now.

167
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,290
She's brilliant, and she's
a very good businesswoman.

168
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,510
I ran the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission

169
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:39,480
and had an opportunity
to meet with her a lot

170
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:45,300
because she ran the swap dealer
association ISDA at the time,

171
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:50,513
or was the outside chair
of ISDA, if I recall.

172
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:52,930
And then we're going to talk
about the business trade-offs

173
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,110
as well.

174
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,340
But what do you think some
of the central business

175
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,470
trade-offs, if I could
get two or three of you

176
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,870
to help me out on what
are the central business

177
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:09,560
trade-offs between permissioned
and permissionless blockchains?

178
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,960
Let me see if I can get
somebody other than Pria.

179
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,860
Yes.

180
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,240
Remind me of your first name.

181
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,740
AUDIENCE: Misha.

182
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:20,370
So permissioned blockchain have
better privacy and protection,

183
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:22,990
and better scalability.

184
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:25,528
And no mining [INAUDIBLE].

185
00:08:25,528 --> 00:08:27,320
PROFESSOR: Misha, let's
pause for a minute.

186
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:32,510
So better scalability, better
privacy, and the third point

187
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,679
you're saying?

188
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,520
AUDIENCE: No mining.

189
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,419
PROFESSOR: No mining.

190
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:39,200
Or, mining is associated
with this proof of work.

191
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,826
Any other business trade-off?

192
00:08:41,826 --> 00:08:43,909
AUDIENCE: So for
permissioned, you

193
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:45,897
have some more flexibility
with governance.

194
00:08:45,897 --> 00:08:48,605
If you need to make changes, you
don't need to rely [INAUDIBLE]..

195
00:08:48,605 --> 00:08:51,560
PROFESSOR: So more flexibility
of governance, in essence,

196
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,830
because if you have a club
deal or group deal, maybe

197
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:57,140
you can do that
governance changes

198
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:01,690
amongst the group instead of
having thousands of people

199
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,020
participating.

200
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:03,780
Kelly?

201
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,030
AUDIENCE: There's also a key
technological differentiator,

202
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:10,780
which is the coding language
sort of that the inputs can

203
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,350
be made in.

204
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:15,355
So with Hyperledger, they
can use the smart contacts

205
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:20,680
in any variety of them, versus
the alternative, which is

206
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,552
the domain specific language.

207
00:09:22,552 --> 00:09:23,260
PROFESSOR: Right.

208
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:27,550
So Hyperledger at least
promotes themselves in their own

209
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:31,600
write-ups-- because the
reading was really from them--

210
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,910
that their embedded language
is much more flexible,

211
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,030
and that you can use Java,
you can use Go, and so forth--

212
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,320
at least they say they can.

213
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,580
I don't know if it's really
as limited in Ethereum.

214
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:49,390
But they think and they
promote that they're

215
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,550
more flexible than Ethereum.

216
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,050
So Kelly's right in that, too.

217
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,730
So these were the readings.

218
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,850
And now, so we're
back to basics again.

219
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,470
What is a blockchain?

220
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,690
I know we've spent four
or five lectures on it,

221
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:08,740
but these key components--

222
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,610
let's start.

223
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:13,780
Append-only timestamped logs.

224
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,990
Are they both--
by show of hands,

225
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:20,500
are they in permissionless
blockchains?

226
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:24,760
I hope every single
hand goes up.

227
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,900
Are they in permissioned
or closed blockchains?

228
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,860
I'm watching.

229
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,560
I'm not-- I'm just
going to watch.

230
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,060
All right.

231
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,130
Every hand should go up.

232
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:42,670
So both sets of blockchains
have this concept

233
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,700
that goes back nearly
30 years to our friend

234
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:51,370
Haber, who started the
whole blockchain that's

235
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:53,200
in The New York Times.

236
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,300
This whole concept is in
both sets of blockchains.

237
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,069
Brotish?

238
00:10:57,069 --> 00:10:58,986
AUDIENCE: So I have a
question about basically

239
00:10:58,986 --> 00:11:04,858
kind of [INAUDIBLE] append-only
[INAUDIBLE] of the ledger.

240
00:11:04,858 --> 00:11:06,400
I think I read in
one of the readings

241
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,930
that Corda has a
feature where you

242
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:11,380
can make some changes to
the history, which is not

243
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,680
equivalent to a hard fault.
So that will probably

244
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,870
be one example where
it is not purely

245
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,805
append-only in a
permission [INAUDIBLE]..

246
00:11:18,805 --> 00:11:20,680
PROFESSOR: So Brotish
is raising that there's

247
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,840
certain features
that are promoted

248
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,380
in one of the private
blockchains, Corda,

249
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:31,450
that may allow you not to
append-only, but in essence,

250
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:36,080
delete data, or
replace data, possibly.

251
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:42,305
And I'm not-- because there's
also, in private blockchains,

252
00:11:42,305 --> 00:11:46,600
an inability to partition,
and in essence, sh--

253
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,760
it's kind of a
form of shorting--

254
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,380
but to partition the data.

255
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,350
I don't know enough about
Corda, whether they literally

256
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,030
allow you to delete--

257
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,940
or is it something
in this partitioning?

258
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,120
But maybe Hugo?

259
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,500
AUDIENCE: I was going to raise
a similar point that if--

260
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,250
I mean, to my understanding, if
you have a permissioned system

261
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:10,595
and there are only a small
number of-- we'll still

262
00:12:10,595 --> 00:12:14,660
call them nodes, then if you
realize you did something

263
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,750
wrong, or something
needs to be changed,

264
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,926
can't they all go
in and change that?

265
00:12:19,926 --> 00:12:21,920
PROFESSOR: So Hugo's
raising the point,

266
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,710
if you're down to,
like, three nodes--

267
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:29,180
as I've shared with you all,
the Australian Stock Exchange

268
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,400
is putting a
permissioned blockchain

269
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,600
up using Digital Asset Holdings,
which I think is backed by also

270
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,660
the Hyperledger
Fabric technology.

271
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,030
But if it's just the
Australian Stock Exchange,

272
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,700
and it's one node,
or three nodes,

273
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,330
couldn't they just
change it on all three?

274
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,860
And I think, in essence, yes.

275
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:52,820
I mean, that may not be what
the database structure is,

276
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:57,740
but I still think
it's potentially yes.

277
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,850
So as you get more
concentration,

278
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,640
you have more chance.

279
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,800
But Brotish, I will try
to research the Corda

280
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:06,882
thing more specifically.

281
00:13:06,882 --> 00:13:09,480
Other thoughts?

282
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,860
So then you create an auditable
database-- some database

283
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,960
with cryptography.

284
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,840
Hash functions, which half
the class said they understood

285
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,096
and the other half
was sort of, you

286
00:13:21,096 --> 00:13:29,450
know, a little rough on, all
is in permissioned systems,

287
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:33,470
using cryptographic
schemes to ensure

288
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:36,560
for the validity of the
data and, so to speak,

289
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,710
the immutable
nature of the data.

290
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:43,760
What's different is
consensus protocols.

291
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,640
In essence, it all goes down,
except for Brotish's point,

292
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:50,630
maybe, about Corda, as
to who gets the chance

293
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,490
to add the additional data.

294
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:59,000
Is it a small club deal,
or is it broad, wide open?

295
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,300
Everybody together, roughly?

296
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,200
So back to the
technical features.

297
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,910
Remember, it's a
bunch of cryptography.

298
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:11,850
Love it or hate it, it
actually allows us all

299
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:14,100
to use the internet--
well past, obviously,

300
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:18,000
the blockchain that we're
discussing in this class.

301
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,720
Network consensus, and
then all the ledgers.

302
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,870
So both permissioned and
permissionless have ledgers,

303
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,240
have cryptography.

304
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,170
It's that middle bucket that's
different between the two.

305
00:14:33,732 --> 00:14:35,190
So what were some
of the challenges

306
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:40,390
that we talked
about in blockchain?

307
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:42,490
We just talked about them
10 minutes ago, which

308
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,410
is, what's the list again?

309
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:45,700
See, this is the easy part.

310
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:50,210
If you haven't spoken yet, this
is, like, the easy questions.

311
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:53,200
Oh, I'm hopelessly shameless.

312
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,450
Yes.

313
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:57,920
Do you want to say your first
name so Toledo takes you

314
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,530
off the list?

315
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:01,000
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

316
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,310
PROFESSOR: Did you get it?

317
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:02,810
No.

318
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,160
Do you want to say it louder?

319
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,460
Because Thalita [INAUDIBLE].

320
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:09,986
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

321
00:15:09,986 --> 00:15:11,954
[LAUGHTER]

322
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:18,160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] issue
about the scalability.

323
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,125
PROFESSOR: Scalability.

324
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,800
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
takes the time

325
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,195
to create the next
block about [INAUDIBLE]..

326
00:15:24,195 --> 00:15:25,070
PROFESSOR: All right.

327
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,470
So scalability and some time.

328
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,420
So efficiency and scalability.

329
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,970
Anything else?

330
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:31,790
AUDIENCE: Privacy?

331
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:32,582
PROFESSOR: Privacy.

332
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,710
So it's basically
the scalability,

333
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:43,140
the privacy are two big things
that permissioned systems

334
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,580
address.

335
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:48,870
Interoperability-- basically,
how does this blockchain

336
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,600
talk to other blockchains,
or how does this blockchain

337
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,500
talk to other legacy systems?

338
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,540
Permissioned and
permissionless systems

339
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:01,710
both have issues of
interoperability.

340
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,840
However, the smaller
the club deal,

341
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,070
the more likely that a bank or
the Australian Stock Exchange

342
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:10,920
might address its
interoperability right within

343
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,790
the system, whereas if
it's a big open-sourced,

344
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,800
open project--

345
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,480
so IBM would say, we can even
help you with interoperability.

346
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,450
IBM would say, we can help
you with all four lines.

347
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:27,060
We can help you with
scalability, efficiency.

348
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,298
We can help you with privacy.

349
00:16:29,298 --> 00:16:30,840
We can help you with
interoperability

350
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:31,500
and governance.

351
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,460
I think it's less clear
they can help with all four,

352
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:39,390
but they can certainly
help with the first two.

353
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:43,140
And Alon, you've switched
from using a permissionless

354
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,750
to a permissioned system--

355
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,500
AUDIENCE: Correct.

356
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,150
PROFESSOR: --in
your startup, right?

357
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:51,390
Which of these four is the
reason why you switched?

358
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,012
AUDIENCE: So
actually, I switched--

359
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,220
PROFESSOR: Or something else?

360
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,262
AUDIENCE: Something else.

361
00:16:55,262 --> 00:16:57,110
So for me, it was a
business use case.

362
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,080
So I was trying--

363
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,615
my business is selling to banks.

364
00:16:59,615 --> 00:17:01,990
PROFESSOR: So that's the next
line-- commercial use case.

365
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:04,310
AUDIENCE: There it is.

366
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:06,420
PROFESSOR: There's a setup.

367
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,214
So what was the reason
that you switched?

368
00:17:08,214 --> 00:17:10,589
AUDIENCE: So I was building
on Ethereum, which is public.

369
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:14,579
And I thought that it's unlikely
that, in the near future,

370
00:17:14,579 --> 00:17:16,170
banks are going
to adopt Ethereum

371
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,730
as their underlying technology.

372
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:20,280
And then I learned
about R3 and Corda,

373
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,040
and learned that banks
actually funded that project.

374
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,845
So I switched to where
the banks put their money.

375
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:28,470
PROFESSOR: So I would
contend that it's

376
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,300
a bit about interoperability.

377
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,240
You felt your
users would be more

378
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:37,470
likely to be able to
work with your system

379
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:41,640
if you were using Corda, with
which they were familiar.

380
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,570
AUDIENCE: Correct.

381
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:45,745
So there's a business reason
and technological reason.

382
00:17:45,745 --> 00:17:47,370
PROFESSOR: And then,
of course, there's

383
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:48,930
the public policy reasons.

384
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:51,480
And IBM would even
say that they're

385
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,350
going to score higher
points on the public policy

386
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,000
if, for no other
reason, that there's

387
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,470
better privacy and security.

388
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:02,710
Now, I'm not trying
to shill for IBM.

389
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:05,800
I'm just saying these would
be their selling points--

390
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,816
or Corda, or elsewhere.

391
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,810
We talked about
Buterin's trilemma.

392
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:16,720
But in another way,
many people would

393
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,760
say decentralization competes
with scalability and security.

394
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,630
If you want scalability
and security,

395
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:26,200
you can't have decentralization.

396
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,320
I'm not a big believer
in this trilemma,

397
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,510
even though I've
now raised it twice.

398
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:36,250
But it's often talked about
at blockchain conferences,

399
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,490
and blockchain papers,
and business discussions.

400
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:43,690
So I've always told you I want
to be a fair representation

401
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:47,230
of the debate that's going on.

402
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:52,390
I think it's more possible to
solve these three over time

403
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:55,150
together than some others.

404
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:58,660
But maybe I'm just a cockeyed
optimist about technology.

405
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,300
So public policy framework.

406
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,800
What were the big
three slipstreams?

407
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,670
So I went fast last time--

408
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:08,530
last class.

409
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:11,846
Leonardo, what are you
going to tell me about the--

410
00:19:11,846 --> 00:19:14,090
it's because you were
adjusting your glasses.

411
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,880
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

412
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,400
No, we spoke about
the difficulty

413
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,810
to implement framework.

414
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:26,430
And you were talking more
about the need [INAUDIBLE]

415
00:19:26,430 --> 00:19:29,617
offer security to
protect people.

416
00:19:29,617 --> 00:19:31,200
PROFESSOR: To protect
people-- so it's

417
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,670
sort of a privacy thing.

418
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:37,860
I think I have a hand
up here from Catalina.

419
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:41,260
AUDIENCE: There are three big
things that [INAUDIBLE] public

420
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:45,090
policy working against
illicit activity--

421
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:48,030
PROFESSOR: Illicit activity.

422
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:51,360
AUDIENCE: --financial
instability, and protecting

423
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,751
the investors.

424
00:19:52,751 --> 00:19:53,751
PROFESSOR: There you go.

425
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:56,700
All right.

426
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,960
So you know my style.

427
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,390
I try to drop things
into three buckets.

428
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:03,810
But it's the only way I
can remember anything.

429
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:07,920
But it is the three
big buckets, of course.

430
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,028
And since I went
fast last time--

431
00:20:11,028 --> 00:20:13,070
and we're going to be
coming back to a lot of it,

432
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,047
but were there any
questions that you have?

433
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,380
And this is just an opportunity.

434
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,348
Brotish?

435
00:20:17,348 --> 00:20:19,390
AUDIENCE: So I have a
question on the [INAUDIBLE]

436
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,320
stability point.

437
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:24,600
Like, you mentioned that
because of the world

438
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:28,800
value of the digital currency
is very minimal compared to,

439
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,500
let's say, [INAUDIBLE].

440
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,700
PROFESSOR: The value
of crypto finance

441
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,750
is about $220 billion right now,
compared to worldwide capital

442
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:43,215
markets that, in aggregate,
are over $300 trillion

443
00:20:43,215 --> 00:20:46,780
of debt, bonds, and equities.

444
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,410
AUDIENCE: So my question was
more like [INAUDIBLE] opinion

445
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:53,880
on this, that this value is also
concentrated within a limited

446
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,970
number of people compared to
the other assets that we are

447
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:59,490
talking about, and hence--

448
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:02,610
I mean, it can still be
important to regularize

449
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:04,455
on the financial
stability side, because it

450
00:21:04,455 --> 00:21:08,520
can have a effect which is not
in proportion to just the size.

451
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,920
PROFESSOR: So Brotish is
asking the question that even

452
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:14,460
though it's only $200
billion versus $300

453
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:19,900
plus trillion of worldwide
financial assets,

454
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:23,860
couldn't it still be relevant
to financial stability?

455
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,360
And the answer is yes.

456
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,830
But it's still relatively-- it's
less than one one-thousandths

457
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,960
of the broad size.

458
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,260
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

459
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,520
PROFESSOR: Yes, please.

460
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,560
Better you than me.

461
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,100
AUDIENCE: So basically,
we did an analysis between

462
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:45,200
the correlation [INAUDIBLE]
public market [INAUDIBLE]

463
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,320
and basically there's a
correlation of roughly 80%

464
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,160
to 85% when the public--

465
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,820
when the Bitcoin market's
down, within the past year,

466
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,620
the public market's
likely to lift up.

467
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:00,150
Because there's a lot of
leverage built into the system.

468
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:04,070
And once the
volatility kicks in,

469
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:06,410
a lot of the
investors [INAUDIBLE]

470
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:08,590
they have to get money out
from the public market,

471
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,990
and that kind of
feeds into a loop.

472
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,990
PROFESSOR: So you're
saying there's correlation,

473
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:15,540
and there may be feedback loops.

474
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,308
Tom?

475
00:22:16,308 --> 00:22:17,850
AUDIENCE: Sort of
a related question.

476
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:20,940
So Mervyn King was in this
room a couple hours ago,

477
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,430
and he was talking
about, in the '08 crisis,

478
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:27,270
two issues of trust-- one where
there was a counterparty trust

479
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,650
issue.

480
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,750
Even though the overall
derivatives market

481
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:34,230
was [INAUDIBLE],, banks
didn't individually

482
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:36,640
know which other bank
was most at risk.

483
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,120
And so they wouldn't
trade with each other

484
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,590
or lend to one another.

485
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:43,680
And then on the opposite
side, the solution--

486
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:47,040
the salvation-- was two
people in a room trusting

487
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,290
each other that the central
bank-- that the government

488
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:53,100
would fund tens of billions of
dollars [INAUDIBLE] capital.

489
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:58,170
And so I wonder your
thoughts on blockchain's role

490
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:00,690
in addressing that
first problem of knowing

491
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:02,190
your counterparty,
or at least being

492
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:05,880
able to trust their
position, and then the risk

493
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,780
of eliminating the second
chance of injection of capital

494
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:13,730
into the financial
system in a blockchain.

495
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:14,938
PROFESSOR: Russ, [INAUDIBLE].

496
00:23:14,938 --> 00:23:16,063
AUDIENCE: I had a question.

497
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:17,010
It's related to this--

498
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:17,100
PROFESSOR: All right.

499
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,175
AUDIENCE: --which is--

500
00:23:18,175 --> 00:23:19,300
PROFESSOR: Thanks, Brotish.

501
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,650
[INAUDIBLE]

502
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,910
AUDIENCE: But the
question is this.

503
00:23:22,910 --> 00:23:25,410
It does strike me that you
only have a financial stability

504
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:32,400
problem if people are relying
on the value of people's

505
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,310
Bitcoin holdings, for example,
which is the bulk of crypto

506
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:37,230
assets, right?

507
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:39,480
The reason you have the
problem during the crisis

508
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,472
is you have all these banks.

509
00:23:41,472 --> 00:23:43,680
They're carrying these assets
on their balance sheet.

510
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,138
And all of the
sudden, people think

511
00:23:45,138 --> 00:23:47,910
they don't know what
they're worth, right?

512
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:51,750
Who, if anyone, is actually
carrying a Bitcoin assets

513
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,607
on a balance sheet that
someone else is relying on?

514
00:23:54,607 --> 00:23:56,940
Or, to put it differently,
who's extending the leverage?

515
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,370
PROFESSOR: All right.

516
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:58,060
So let me--

517
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,970
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

518
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:01,950
PROFESSOR: Let me
wrap these together.

519
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:05,640
I think that what many central
bankers and the Financial

520
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,190
Stability Board would
say, at 200 billion

521
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:14,170
versus 300 trillion, it's
probably not that financially

522
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:16,540
relevant at this point.

523
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:21,310
Where it could get relevant is,
as Russ has sort of suggested,

524
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:23,410
is if there's
leverage behind it.

525
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:26,975
If it's in a balance sheet, it's
an asset on a balance sheet,

526
00:24:26,975 --> 00:24:28,810
and there's a liability
on the other side.

527
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:31,880
And thus it could
bring down that entity,

528
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,950
whether it's a hedge
fund, whether it's a bank.

529
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:40,090
But something that's relying
[INAUDIBLE] to tie it

530
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:43,020
back to the questions
that Tom raised

531
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:48,760
is, could blockchain
lower systemic risk?

532
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:53,320
Possibly, if it's a
better database solution.

533
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,590
If it answers-- what Mervyn
King was speaking about,

534
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:59,000
we also addressed
in the late 90s.

535
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,680
I remember quite well
when Secretary Rubin

536
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,640
called a number of us
into his office and said,

537
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,560
I don't understand.

538
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,562
The banks can't tell us
their exposure to Korea.

539
00:25:08,562 --> 00:25:09,520
A number of countries--

540
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,610
South Korea was about
to have-- but they

541
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,230
didn't default on
their debt, but they

542
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:17,200
were coming close to
defaulting on their debt.

543
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,480
And of course, it was
only a short while

544
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,210
before other countries,
like Indonesia and Thailand,

545
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:27,310
were getting into that
same debt challenge.

546
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:31,080
But why couldn't banks tell
the US Department of Treasury

547
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:31,705
their exposure?

548
00:25:31,705 --> 00:25:35,080
It's usually
through derivatives.

549
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,640
And derivatives,
both in the late '90s

550
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,230
and the financial
crisis, were often

551
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:45,340
something that propagated
risk through the system.

552
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,590
Now, the numbers were larger--

553
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:49,510
I mean, depending upon the time.

554
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:51,280
The '90s was less than this.

555
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,910
But it was $300, $400
trillion of notional amount

556
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:56,390
of derivatives.

557
00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:00,040
So just the sheer
notional size, even

558
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,900
though the capital at
risk in derivatives

559
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:05,670
was much smaller
because the leverage

560
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:08,220
of this notional--
big, notional size.

561
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:11,980
And the transparency
was pretty low.

562
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,180
It wasn't zero, actually.

563
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,560
It wasn't zero.

564
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,180
But it was really low.

565
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:21,490
And so I think that's
what Mervyn King would

566
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:22,540
have been mentioning.

567
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:26,800
And I do think blockchain can
help in that transparency.

568
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,720
But it takes a big
collective action.

569
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,990
And so Europe, the US,
and Asia-- a lot of laws

570
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,930
were passed to get more
transparency in the derivatives

571
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,370
space.

572
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:39,220
Brotish, I would say that
there could be problems.

573
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:42,640
And I've had conversations
with elected leaders that

574
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,460
say, don't get
lulled into the sense

575
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:49,100
that it won't have
financial stability issues.

576
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,830
Because that was what
happened in the 1980s and '90s

577
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:55,940
when people said, well,
derivatives will not

578
00:26:55,940 --> 00:27:01,210
create instability,
because it's only

579
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:05,080
the institutional investors,
the sophisticated investors--

580
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:10,030
the so to speak big boys
or big girls, you know?

581
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:16,990
And I was part of those debates,
that consensus that formed that

582
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:19,690
it was only institutional
and it wouldn't--

583
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:23,170
but there was a lot of leverage
and a lack of transparency when

584
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:24,490
big leverage--

585
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:26,890
multiple hundreds of
trillions of dollars--

586
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:31,060
associated with it, of course,
was part of the crisis--

587
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,500
not the only part of the crisis.

588
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,430
But any other
questions before Hugo?

589
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:36,160
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

590
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,752
On the protecting the
investing public front,

591
00:27:38,752 --> 00:27:42,310
I was just wondering,
like, a lot of people

592
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:45,940
are now using Robinhood and
zero fee things like that

593
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:48,130
to invest in the stock market.

594
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:51,400
And companies like
Robinhood and Vanguard

595
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:55,420
often sell order book data
to high frequency traders

596
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,880
so that they can kind
of know what's going on

597
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,250
and maybe front run.

598
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:05,320
So I was wondering how
that fits into what

599
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,000
we were talking
about last time where

600
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,440
there's no transparency on
many of the cryptocurrency

601
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,400
exchanges.

602
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:17,380
And then in addition to that,
big institutional investors

603
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:22,690
can, I think, buy upwards
of 5% of any stock

604
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:28,100
and then wait a few days before
they have to report on that.

605
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,540
So that can also have a
huge effect on stock price.

606
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:35,380
And then they can,
afterwards, dump on people.

607
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,830
So how is that different
from what's going on

608
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,120
in cryptocurrency exchanges?

609
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:40,390
PROFESSOR: All right.

610
00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:41,980
So that's an investor
protection one.

611
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,630
Was there another one in the--

612
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:45,040
is this investor
protection, or--

613
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,790
AUDIENCE: No, it's a
little bit different.

614
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:47,880
PROFESSOR: A little different.

615
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,210
All right.

616
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:49,350
Any other investor protection?

617
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,610
Because I'm going to collect
them and then [INAUDIBLE]..

618
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:52,170
AUDIENCE: It's about the former.

619
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,460
I was a little bit--

620
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:58,120
it was kind of [INAUDIBLE] to me
when you say the blockchain can

621
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,100
help to stabilize the
financial markets--

622
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:00,210
PROFESSOR: All right.

623
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:01,540
So that's back to
financial stability.

624
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,100
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

625
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:02,460
If it can--

626
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,335
PROFESSOR: All right.

627
00:29:03,335 --> 00:29:03,990
Can I hold it?

628
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:07,300
Let me just answer Hugo's
investor protection one.

629
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:13,010
So all markets-- not
just crypto markets--

630
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:17,810
all markets are susceptible to
some forms of front running.

631
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:21,380
In essence, if you have
a client relationship

632
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:24,470
and you get information
from your client that

633
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:28,100
might affect the
market pricing, you

634
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:32,480
might jump ahead of that
client with their information.

635
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,200
Their information might be
a buy order, a sell order.

636
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,850
Or frankly, it might be
some other information.

637
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:42,170
But traditionally, if they have
a buy order or a sell order,

638
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:43,790
you have information.

639
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:49,300
And then you're sort of jumping
ahead and saying, all right.

640
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,190
I'll buy or sell
in front of them.

641
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:53,710
That's the classic
sort of front running,

642
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:57,550
even though there's
other methods.

643
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:59,050
It's not supposed to happen.

644
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:04,870
On regulated exchanges, you
have some policing of it.

645
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,640
Even before
governments stood in,

646
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,110
you could have
some policing of it

647
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:11,590
in self-regulatory
organizations.

648
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:16,600
In the crypto world, there
is Katy bar the door.

649
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,670
Anything can really happen.

650
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:21,820
And it's my belief
and understanding

651
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,940
that many crypto
exchanges-- not all of them.

652
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:25,670
Not all of them.

653
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:27,940
But many crypto
exchanges are basically

654
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:32,200
trading in front
of their customers.

655
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,590
And in fact, most
crypto exchanges

656
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:39,190
make markets, as they
are both market makers--

657
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:42,430
meaning they are buying when
you're selling and selling

658
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,390
when you're buying.

659
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:45,300
That's the nature
of a market maker.

660
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,490
It's very typical, very
legal, very important

661
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:49,750
function of market.

662
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:52,720
But the exchanges are
both market makers,

663
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,790
and then they show order books.

664
00:30:54,790 --> 00:31:00,120
And so it sort of helps
them do front running.

665
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,030
Not that a lot of people
necessarily agree with me,

666
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:05,250
I think these markets
would be better off

667
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:08,850
if there were some forms of
rules about front running

668
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:11,070
and manipulation in
markets and the like.

669
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:13,320
On your 5% question,
can we take it up

670
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,760
in office hours or something?

671
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,650
Because it's sort of
outside of crypto.

672
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:19,320
But I would be glad to
talk about the SEC rules

673
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,168
about the 5%.

674
00:31:21,168 --> 00:31:22,335
Is this investor protection?

675
00:31:22,335 --> 00:31:23,270
And that--

676
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,210
AUDIENCE: I think so.

677
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:27,390
The reading that we had
that talked about the Fabric

678
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:29,010
technology, it
mentioned something

679
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:31,950
about execute order validate.

680
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:34,740
Does that mechanism
tie into the way

681
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,750
that front running
would work at all?

682
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,650
PROFESSOR: All
blockchain technology,

683
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:42,810
whether it's permissioned,
like Fabric, or permissionless,

684
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:44,690
can--

685
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:47,280
if it was efficient
and scalable--

686
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:51,480
could help out, because you
could actually timestamp

687
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,340
when did the order come in.

688
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:56,310
When did the
client's information

689
00:31:56,310 --> 00:32:00,180
get to the exchange, and is
somebody standing in front?

690
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,910
AUDIENCE: So it's
sort of like a cascade

691
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:05,450
that you can't necessarily
pause once it starts?

692
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:06,450
PROFESSOR: Right, right.

693
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:10,470
So if you look at the algorithms
at the New York Stock Exchange

694
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:13,382
right now, which
are not blockchain--

695
00:32:13,382 --> 00:32:15,090
they're not permissioned,
and they're not

696
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:16,390
permissionless blockchain.

697
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:19,740
But if you look at both the
algorithms and the data flows,

698
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,023
they have very
good timestamping.

699
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,440
I'm not going to
say it's perfect,

700
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,940
but they have very
good timestamping

701
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:28,440
to ensure when are orders--

702
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,630
basically message timestamping
every message that comes in.

703
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:36,300
And some order books, like
the New York Stock Exchange--

704
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:41,280
some order books are
price and time priority,

705
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:45,960
price priority meaning high bid
gets hit before the next bid,

706
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,800
or lowest offer
gets lifted first.

707
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,720
That's price priority.

708
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,670
But they might also
have time priority

709
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:57,570
for any bid that has the same
price and any offer that's

710
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:59,040
the same price.

711
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,140
So they have to have
very good timestamping.

712
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:08,040
I truly believe you could
not use a blockchain

713
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:12,540
solution for the New York Stock
Exchange order book right now.

714
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:15,020
Whether you can in 10
years, I'm not sure.

715
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:19,740
But time latency is so relevant
in the middle of those order

716
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,830
books--

717
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:22,860
you know, the
nanoseconds that matter.

718
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,715
I'm going to take this
stability question.

719
00:33:24,715 --> 00:33:26,280
There were two
stability-- and then

720
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:30,610
we're going to move on to
the rest of today's lecture.

721
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:31,760
You're having fun now.

722
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,580
AUDIENCE: Can you
explain a little bit more

723
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:37,060
about, like, well,
say if blockchain

724
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:40,630
can be a better
database so it can help

725
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:42,340
stabilize the financial market?

726
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,110
Can you give some examples?

727
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:46,750
PROFESSOR: So how
blockchain could possibly

728
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:49,030
help-- be a stabilizer.

729
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:52,840
A lot of financial instability--

730
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,640
or, beyond the
financial markets,

731
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,970
instability is a
question of resilience.

732
00:33:57,970 --> 00:34:00,550
And when things are
centralized, you

733
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:04,490
create single points of
failure in any system--

734
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:08,020
really, in military
or financial.

735
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:12,940
You centralize something,
you then, thus--

736
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,830
you know what to attack.

737
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:17,860
You can also maybe have
higher walls or better moats,

738
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:20,199
but you still know of
something to attack.

739
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:23,080
So blockchain, in its
decentralized nature,

740
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,409
might be a more
resilient database,

741
00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:29,239
because even if half or
two thirds of it goes down,

742
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:30,580
you still have the other third.

743
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:33,080
I'm going to say something about
the New York Stock Exchange

744
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:33,969
again.

745
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:35,920
Whether it's the New York Stock
Exchange, the London Stock

746
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,670
Exchange, the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange,

747
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:43,449
they all are required by
their various local laws

748
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:47,449
to have backup data centers.

749
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:52,380
And those backup data centers
even have to be lots of miles

750
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:57,936
away if, God forbid, a bomb
comes and takes out the center.

751
00:34:57,936 --> 00:34:59,250
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

752
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:00,210
PROFESSOR: What's that?

753
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:02,830
It's called-- Its basically
disaster recovery.

754
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:05,550
So maybe blockchain
will be more resilient.

755
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:07,050
I'm going to take
two more questions

756
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:08,425
and then get back
to permissioned

757
00:35:08,425 --> 00:35:09,900
versus permissionless.

758
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,195
Way back in the corner--
your first name, again, is?

759
00:35:12,195 --> 00:35:12,820
AUDIENCE: Matt.

760
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:13,290
PROFESSOR: Matt.

761
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:14,010
Thank you, Matt.

762
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:15,585
I should know that.

763
00:35:15,585 --> 00:35:17,790
AUDIENCE: So I'm kind
of just curious how,

764
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:20,175
essentially, the nasency,
for lack of a better word--

765
00:35:20,175 --> 00:35:21,300
PROFESSOR: The [INAUDIBLE]?

766
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,920
AUDIENCE: Like, the nasency--

767
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,680
how kind of, like,
new this market

768
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,700
is and how that affects policy,
because when you're shaping

769
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,340
policy, and you
don't necessarily

770
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:35,150
have a bunch of years of
knowing how people are going

771
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:38,078
to react to that policy, I
feel like it could almost

772
00:35:38,078 --> 00:35:39,370
be a chicken and egg situation.

773
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,920
PROFESSOR: OK, I understand.

774
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,020
Anybody else with
the same theme?

775
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:43,710
No?

776
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:47,820
So the question is, how
does it affect policy makers

777
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:50,880
when a whole technology is new?

778
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,510
And I would say, we have a
lot of history with this.

779
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:58,080
Whether it was railroads,
or the telegraph,

780
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:01,665
or the telephone, or television,
we have a lot of history.

781
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:07,150
Technology and
commercial applications

782
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:11,600
move ahead of the public sector.

783
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,560
I mean, it's just inevitable.

784
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,720
The official sector,
the public sector--

785
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,420
unless it just basically
does what Mark Carney says,

786
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:22,720
and the choice is to isolate
something, to sort of put up

787
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,580
the moats of a
society and says, we

788
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:27,220
can't use that technology here.

789
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:32,570
Unless you have that, technology
usually supersedes the markets,

790
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:36,080
and the markets and technology
come before official sector.

791
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,990
Depending upon the
area, it can take

792
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:43,710
single digit years and sometimes
decades for public sector

793
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:46,280
to catch up, literally.

794
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,220
But let's take the internet.

795
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:53,340
The internet was being
worked on for 15ish years.

796
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:57,030
But the protocol layer
that helped take off

797
00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:01,290
was the worldwide web
in 1991 or '92, and then

798
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:05,210
the security protocols in '96.

799
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:07,880
Just taking
financial regulation,

800
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:16,075
the SEC was asked in 1995,
could bulletin boards--

801
00:37:16,075 --> 00:37:18,540
there were electronic
bulletin boards

802
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,850
listing stocks and bonds--

803
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:25,890
be exempted from being
considered stock exchanges?

804
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:27,950
Well, the people
that were asking that

805
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:29,930
were the people putting
up the bulletin boards.

806
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:32,280
They didn't want
to be regulated.

807
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,670
The New York Stock Exchange
that was fully regulated,

808
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,500
and NASDAQ that was
fully regulated,

809
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,180
was coming at the
other side and asking

810
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:41,640
the SEC to shut them down.

811
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,610
They didn't want the
competition from the disruptors.

812
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:49,480
It took three years for the
SEC to answer that question.

813
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:52,680
I don't mean answer it,
like, with a letter.

814
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,870
They had to propose a rule, and
they had to do a final rule,

815
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:59,840
and it was three
years to do that.

816
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:04,310
And blockchain, I think,
we are through some

817
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:06,050
of the big questions.

818
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:09,005
We know how most
jurisdictions tax--

819
00:38:09,005 --> 00:38:12,770
T-A-X-- tax it as property
and not as currency,

820
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:14,660
and some of the tax issues.

821
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:17,150
We know, in most
jurisdictions, how

822
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:19,970
it fits into,
broadly, Bank Secrecy

823
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:23,440
Act and illicit activity.

824
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,570
There's very choppy
implementation,

825
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,520
very spotty implementation.

826
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,160
I would say the investor
protection side,

827
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,720
we're at the early stages.

828
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,330
And it's going to take, in most
jurisdictions, another three

829
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:38,570
years, maybe, to sort
through some of how--

830
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:40,308
and this is just crypto finance.

831
00:38:40,308 --> 00:38:40,850
I don't know.

832
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:42,530
Matt, does that--

833
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,470
I'm giving you some predictions.

834
00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:46,230
Some of it could be
multiple decades.

835
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:48,160
We're still, today,
trying to figure out--

836
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,670
the public sector's figuring
out how to regulate Facebook

837
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,210
and Google.

838
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:54,730
I'm going to take one last
question, because I've

839
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:55,720
got to do permissioned.

840
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,560
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
because I was kind of, like--

841
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,300
it kind of answers the side
following the technology.

842
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,840
But I think, for
me, what I was kind

843
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,950
of wondering about was this, the
way we're like-- as soon as you

844
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:08,770
apply regulations to something
that at least a good portion

845
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:12,160
of the market seems to
value being deregulated,

846
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,620
it seems like a lot of
the activity will change,

847
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,780
either in scope or scale.

848
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:18,730
PROFESSOR: So Matt's
raising there's

849
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:20,980
a trade-off about
bringing something

850
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:27,850
under regulation or into
the public policy sphere.

851
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:29,410
I'm probably just
one voice of this,

852
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:31,570
but I think it's probably true.

853
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:33,970
There's very few
economic activities

854
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:38,860
that grow large that stay fully
outside of the public policy

855
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:41,560
framework of a society.

856
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,230
It doesn't mean that public
policy frameworks don't change,

857
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:46,420
get adopted, get adapted.

858
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,430
The internet comes
along, and at first, it's

859
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:50,650
a question of-- you
know, with Amazon,

860
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:52,450
is it going to be taxed or not?

861
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:53,830
Is there sales tax?

862
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:56,290
And then later-- you
know, at first, it's not.

863
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:57,570
Later, it is.

864
00:39:57,570 --> 00:40:00,490
And in some jurisdictions,
questions on the internet

865
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:02,760
was liability.

866
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:06,040
And this was a very critical
question of early internet was,

867
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:09,370
was there liability for
any of the information

868
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:12,610
or the flow of information?

869
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:16,180
I'm talking about libel laws
and all the liability issues

870
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:17,800
and so forth.

871
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:21,700
And so in the US, there's a
section of the law in 1996

872
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,350
was passed.

873
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:25,810
And now we're coming back
and saying, wait a minute.

874
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:29,560
That gave too broad-- it
basically exempted the internet

875
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,530
from liability as carriers.

876
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:36,073
But now, that was
modified in 2018--

877
00:40:36,073 --> 00:40:40,100
22 years later-- to say, well,
if it has to do, I think,

878
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:44,080
with basically children
trafficking and slavery

879
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:47,860
and everything, maybe we should
tighten that up a little bit.

880
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:57,000
So I don't believe any
broad economic activity

881
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:04,155
is going to remain fully outside
public policy frameworks.

882
00:41:04,155 --> 00:41:08,160
And I'm glad to be
challenged on that.

883
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,085
And I think blockchain, and
particularly crypto finance,

884
00:41:11,085 --> 00:41:13,740
is at this grappling
stage to get in.

885
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,240
So let me move
forward, because this

886
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,160
is more about permissioned
and permissionless.

887
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,410
I just wanted to
cover some of these.

888
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:22,470
We will cover initial coin
offerings and the public policy

889
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:24,990
issues around initial coin
offerings in the Howey Test.

890
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:26,780
We will cover crypto
exchanges, and we

891
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:30,210
will cover central bank
digital currencies a lot

892
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:31,710
in the second half
of this semester.

893
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:38,810
So back to the trade-offs
that we talked about already--

894
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:41,960
the trade-offs of centralization
and decentralizations

895
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:46,430
and Coase's work from
the 1930s about the firm.

896
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:47,960
This is the cost, remember.

897
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,830
This is the cost.

898
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:52,160
As we get centralized, there's
more cost of economic rents,

899
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:56,600
single points of
failure, and capture.

900
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,780
Some fragility, in a
sense, in the system.

901
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:03,990
But decentralization
has its cost as well.

902
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:07,340
You'll notice that these two
lines are crossing somewhere.

903
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:10,850
It was my failed attempt
to say, you know,

904
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:12,260
maybe there's a balance.

905
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:16,130
Maybe overall, while
some organizations

906
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:18,530
will find all the way
to decentralization,

907
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:20,780
and some to
centralization, I think

908
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:24,350
economic systems tend more
towards the centralized side

909
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:26,090
of things.

910
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:30,310
But you can change the slope
of these two lines if you want.

911
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:36,240
I'm just trying to give you a
framework of thinking about it.

912
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:39,390
So as we've talked about,
the financial sector

913
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:42,840
pretty much favors
permissioned systems.

914
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:47,590
The financial sector is
saying, going back, no.

915
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:52,170
Too many costs of coordination,
governance, security, privacy,

916
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:54,262
and scalability.

917
00:42:54,262 --> 00:42:55,470
We're over in the other side.

918
00:42:58,250 --> 00:43:02,390
And so that's where
they are today.

919
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:05,040
I'm not sure that's where
they'll be in five or 10 years,

920
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,870
but it is definitely
where they are today.

921
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,983
So let's go back down
our list, in a sense.

922
00:43:13,983 --> 00:43:15,650
I'm going to have a
bunch of check marks

923
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:16,840
and x's on the right.

924
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:20,580
Where do you think I'm going
to have check marks and x's?

925
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,600
This is the same
three big buckets,

926
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,040
because I can't
think of anything.

927
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:27,823
Emily, do you have
a point of view?

928
00:43:27,823 --> 00:43:29,240
AUDIENCE: I mean,
I think in terms

929
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:32,480
of the permissioned technical
features, one of them

930
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,213
is obviously that it's not
using that proof of work.

931
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:37,130
PROFESSOR: Not using--

932
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:38,540
AUDIENCE: It's not using
the same proof of work.

933
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:39,998
PROFESSOR: Not
using proof of work.

934
00:43:39,998 --> 00:43:45,040
So I had to give away-- you
know, reveal the [INAUDIBLE]..

935
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:51,430
All the cryptography that's
used in permissionless systems

936
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:53,310
is used in the
permissioned systems.

937
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:55,430
It might be used a
little differently.

938
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:59,080
I'm not going to say the Merkle
trees are exactly the same.

939
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:02,880
But all that broccoli we were
eating a few lectures ago

940
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,465
are relevant on both sides.

941
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:09,415
Sorry, Alin.

942
00:44:09,415 --> 00:44:10,290
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

943
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:10,860
PROFESSOR: What's that?

944
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:11,090
You--

945
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:11,796
AUDIENCE: I like broccoli.

946
00:44:11,796 --> 00:44:13,004
PROFESSOR: You like broccoli.

947
00:44:13,004 --> 00:44:15,630
A computer scientist speaking.

948
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:18,300
Everything, though, about
digital signatures and hash

949
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:22,480
functions and so forth are
relevant to both of these.

950
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,870
But they're not
necessarily relevant

951
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:27,600
to every traditional
database, which we'll

952
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:31,320
talk about in 10 minutes or so.

953
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:34,460
But as Emily said,
there's really not--

954
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:35,150
I said, no.

955
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:38,180
There's not decentralized
network consensus.

956
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:41,150
I'm stretching it a little bit,
because permissioned systems

957
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:42,600
can be decentralized.

958
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:46,930
There could be five
or 10 or 20 nodes.

959
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:48,730
And so that is decentralized.

960
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:51,160
So I shouldn't have
really said no.

961
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,560
I should have said
maybe, or hybrid.

962
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:59,250
And instead of proof of work,
the permissioned systems

963
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:02,160
use a bunch of
consensus mechanisms.

964
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,290
And I just listed
a couple notary

965
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:13,700
nodes or PBFT for Byzantine
Fault Tolerance again.

966
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:16,380
But they don't have
native currencies.

967
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:20,060
So that is a very
big difference--

968
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:21,560
no native currency.

969
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:24,860
If you have a solution
for your final projects,

970
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:27,878
or you have a solution for
some entrepreneurial business

971
00:45:27,878 --> 00:45:29,420
that you're going
to do in the future

972
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:32,420
that you want a native currency,
you're probably more over

973
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:35,777
into the permissionless world.

974
00:45:35,777 --> 00:45:37,860
You want to have an incentive
structure, something

975
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:43,080
to motivate customers or users,
or create token economics.

976
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:47,290
Token economics is more
in the permissionless.

977
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:51,460
I say more because you
can create a token even

978
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:53,680
in the permissioned space.

979
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,670
We'll talk about it in a moment.

980
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:59,880
And then transaction
script or UTXOs.

981
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,700
They're not technically
UTXOs in a bunch

982
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:06,180
of permissioned systems,
but you need some ledger.

983
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:09,540
This last box, if I
just called it ledgers,

984
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:12,360
you'd still have ledgers in.

985
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:15,570
So it's really the consensus
mechanism in the middle,

986
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:18,610
as Emily said.

987
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:22,030
A couple of key design features.

988
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:25,900
First, membership's limited
to basically an authorized set

989
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:27,552
of nodes.

990
00:46:27,552 --> 00:46:31,640
So does anybody want to
say, if you were a bank,

991
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:35,150
who you might-- you know,
what might you do if you were

992
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:37,940
a bank, and who might you
authorize if you're doing

993
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:38,560
a bank--

994
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,410
I don't know.

995
00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:46,030
Let's say that it
was loans, or if it's

996
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:47,640
Mark Snyderman's real estate.

997
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:50,340
It's real estate loans.

998
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,930
Could you ever see
real estate loans

999
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:55,672
going on a blockchain, Mark?

1000
00:46:55,672 --> 00:46:56,880
MARK SNYDERMAN: Loans, maybe.

1001
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:57,900
Loans could.

1002
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:58,140
PROFESSOR: All right.

1003
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:58,650
So--

1004
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:01,463
MARK SNYDERMAN: Loans
aren't traded as much.

1005
00:47:01,463 --> 00:47:02,880
PROFESSOR: So if
real estate loans

1006
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,080
were on a permissioned
blockchain,

1007
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:08,870
who might be that
membership, the limited--

1008
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:14,040
who would-- it's not just
a rhetorical question.

1009
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,742
Who would actually care about
the database of the loans?

1010
00:47:17,742 --> 00:47:19,200
MARK SNYDERMAN:
Broker dealers that

1011
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:23,280
are active in loans,
institutional investors that

1012
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,380
are active in loans.

1013
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:29,230
PROFESSOR: So the
broker dealers who

1014
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:31,563
are actually trading the
loans, and maybe the investors.

1015
00:47:31,563 --> 00:47:32,075
Alon?

1016
00:47:32,075 --> 00:47:32,700
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1017
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:36,338
Just rating agencies when
you securitize those loans--

1018
00:47:36,338 --> 00:47:37,380
AUDIENCE: Loan servicers.

1019
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:37,760
AUDIENCE: Loan servicers.

1020
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:39,440
PROFESSOR: Amanda,
loan servicers.

1021
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,620
So maybe loan servicers,
maybe the rating agencies.

1022
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:47,870
So it's basically, who has
a need and needs that data?

1023
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:50,450
I'm not sure that this
is the right community,

1024
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,670
but it's the discussion
I'm thinking about.

1025
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:54,425
And again, as you're
thinking about--

1026
00:47:54,425 --> 00:47:57,290
I'm jumping again to a little
bit final projects, but when

1027
00:47:57,290 --> 00:48:01,700
you're thinking about
who actually needs data

1028
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:06,140
and who has a reason
to amend the data,

1029
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:09,060
or write to the ledger--

1030
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:10,980
because if you don't
have a desire and a need

1031
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:18,300
to actually amend or change the
data, move value in the system,

1032
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:22,190
you might not need
an open database.

1033
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:22,690
Please.

1034
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:24,190
AUDIENCE: When we
were talking about

1035
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:27,910
that additional layer of
blocks, is that layer also--

1036
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:33,152
can you change the
membership with that layer?

1037
00:48:33,152 --> 00:48:35,110
PROFESSOR: I'm not sure
I follow your question.

1038
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:37,726
When you say an additional
layer of blocks--

1039
00:48:37,726 --> 00:48:39,670
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

1040
00:48:39,670 --> 00:48:40,860
PROFESSOR: Oh, I'm sorry.

1041
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:41,505
Layer 2.

1042
00:48:41,505 --> 00:48:42,260
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1043
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:44,220
Can you alter the--

1044
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:48,750
because it's a different level
of refinement of information

1045
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:50,310
that's stored.

1046
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:53,940
PROFESSOR: So what
Kelly is asking is,

1047
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:57,270
we've talked about how
to make permissionless

1048
00:48:57,270 --> 00:49:00,240
blockchains more scalable
by having a layer

1049
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,400
2, like the Lightning Network.

1050
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,800
That's what you're referencing.

1051
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:09,430
So in permissionless systems,
it's open to everyone,

1052
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:13,860
even though if you're opening
up an individual payment

1053
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:15,730
channel in the
Lightning Network,

1054
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:17,550
it's really just
two counterparties

1055
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:19,680
opening up a channel.

1056
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,620
So in a sense, you've
already narrowed the scope,

1057
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:24,390
because you might
just have a payment

1058
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:26,790
channel between two parties--

1059
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:29,460
some side chains or
multiple parties.

1060
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:31,650
Lightning Network
and payment channels

1061
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:34,627
tend to be two parties.

1062
00:49:34,627 --> 00:49:35,460
So I don't know if--

1063
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:36,660
was that what you're asking?

1064
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:38,610
AUDIENCE: That network
in and of itself

1065
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:42,308
is a mechanism of membership.

1066
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:47,940
PROFESSOR: The layer
2 can be a membership.

1067
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:49,200
That is correct.

1068
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,800
But it's a technology that's
available to everybody.

1069
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:58,010
So it has attributes where you
can open up bilateral channels.

1070
00:49:58,010 --> 00:49:58,510
James.

1071
00:49:58,510 --> 00:49:59,050
AUDIENCE: I was
just going to say,

1072
00:49:59,050 --> 00:50:00,800
for permissioned
blockchains, couldn't you

1073
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,330
imagine that the layer
1 would be, say, the Fed

1074
00:50:04,330 --> 00:50:07,125
with all of the big
commercial banks?

1075
00:50:07,125 --> 00:50:08,500
But in effect, if
you're thinking

1076
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:09,917
about a different
layer, you could

1077
00:50:09,917 --> 00:50:12,180
have another layer
on top of that, which

1078
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:13,310
[INAUDIBLE] central banks.

1079
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:13,890
So you could naturally--

1080
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:14,280
PROFESSOR: All right.

1081
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:16,072
AUDIENCE: --have two
layers of deals with--

1082
00:50:16,072 --> 00:50:17,770
PROFESSOR: So where
we're headed is,

1083
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:21,970
is do permissioned
systems have the same need

1084
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:26,080
to have a second layer
as permissionless?

1085
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,000
And even if they don't
have the same needs,

1086
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,550
might it actually
provide something?

1087
00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:33,220
So I would say, I don't
think they have the same need

1088
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:36,460
to have a second layer,
because they're more scalable,

1089
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:39,430
they're more
efficient right now.

1090
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:43,230
And they're already
closed clubs.

1091
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:46,260
But even if they don't
have the same need,

1092
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:49,230
they might actually want to
put a second layer on top.

1093
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:53,350
And some of them actually do
this right in their technology.

1094
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:57,510
And it's what I put up here
as the second and third bullet

1095
00:50:57,510 --> 00:50:58,390
point.

1096
00:50:58,390 --> 00:51:01,620
The transactions can be
limited to only authorized

1097
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:03,240
known participants.

1098
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:08,932
So in many permissioned systems,
it's a one broad technology.

1099
00:51:08,932 --> 00:51:14,450
It might only be 20 people that
can authorize transactions.

1100
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:18,380
But now in some transactions,
it will only be Anton and May.

1101
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:22,940
And in other transactions,
it will be Alpha and Amanda.

1102
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:25,550
So I might not be able to--

1103
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:27,590
by the way, Alpha
might be Goldman Sachs,

1104
00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:30,110
and Amanda might be Barclays.

1105
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:32,150
And then it might
make more sense.

1106
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:35,230
And Mark might be Fidelity.

1107
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:38,530
And I don't know, am I the
US Department of Treasury

1108
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:39,030
in this one?

1109
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,780
Mark and I both
started out in finance.

1110
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:48,740
I just went off to
public service later.

1111
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:54,830
But so Corda and Hyperledger and
many of the private blockchains

1112
00:51:54,830 --> 00:51:59,210
literally allow for partitioning
right in the blockchain.

1113
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:00,980
I don't know if you'd
need to put a layer

1114
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:05,630
2 on top, because they allow
for partitioning and segregated

1115
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:09,060
pools of authority
inside of the blockchain.

1116
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:09,560
I'm sorry?

1117
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,120
There was a question, I thought.

1118
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,374
Oh.

1119
00:52:12,374 --> 00:52:13,210
Oh, yeah.

1120
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:15,440
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] you
see insurance companies,

1121
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:17,773
like title insurance,
as part of this.

1122
00:52:17,773 --> 00:52:18,940
PROFESSOR: Can you speak up?

1123
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:19,457
[INAUDIBLE]

1124
00:52:19,457 --> 00:52:21,790
AUDIENCE: Insurance companies
for title for the houses--

1125
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:22,670
PROFESSOR: Right.

1126
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:25,010
AUDIENCE: --I think blockchain
could be really helpful,

1127
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:28,250
because sometimes you have
the trust issue around who

1128
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:31,160
owned the house before
you, or the title where

1129
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,420
it goes backwards in history.

1130
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:37,700
So I think title
insurance companies

1131
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:40,220
would be part of this blockchain
in terms of [INAUDIBLE]..

1132
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:43,910
PROFESSOR: So your point is,
is that titling of real estate

1133
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:49,065
could be an important part of
blockchains, and as [AUDIO OUT]

1134
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:50,440
MARK SNYDERMAN:
Probably someday,

1135
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:54,850
but every little town has its
own system for keeping property

1136
00:52:54,850 --> 00:52:56,200
records.

1137
00:52:56,200 --> 00:53:00,850
And getting them all to
cooperate in a blockchain

1138
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:05,233
kind of solution seems remote.

1139
00:53:05,233 --> 00:53:07,150
They don't think they
have a real problem that

1140
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:07,990
needs solving.

1141
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:10,640
So yeah, maybe someday.

1142
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,540
But I doubt it will
happen anytime soon.

1143
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:17,240
But it makes some logical sense.

1144
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:20,460
And that would probably be
a permissionless system,

1145
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:23,880
because there's not a huge
amount of times a piece

1146
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:27,480
of property transacts, right?

1147
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:31,260
So it's not like moving
money around the world.

1148
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:35,063
It's a much simpler,
less frequent event.

1149
00:53:35,063 --> 00:53:35,730
AUDIENCE: Yeah--

1150
00:53:35,730 --> 00:53:38,010
MARK SNYDERMAN: And
land records are public.

1151
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:42,710
People often have to go to the
town offices to look at them.

1152
00:53:42,710 --> 00:53:45,900
AUDIENCE: Yeah, you have to
pay a lot of transaction fees,

1153
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:49,595
whether you're transacting on a
plant or anything that involves

1154
00:53:49,595 --> 00:53:51,660
real estate here in the US.

1155
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:54,420
You have to pay
considerable amount of fees

1156
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:56,910
to the title
insurance companies.

1157
00:53:56,910 --> 00:53:59,550
And in my mind, that
could eliminate that role

1158
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:05,720
if you have blockchain and
[INAUDIBLE] where the system.

1159
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:08,580
MARK SNYDERMAN: Maybe,
but you're paying money

1160
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:10,742
because you're asking--

1161
00:54:10,742 --> 00:54:11,700
AUDIENCE: Somebody to--

1162
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:14,820
MARK SNYDERMAN:
--them and lawyers

1163
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:16,665
to make sure the
title's free and clear.

1164
00:54:16,665 --> 00:54:17,550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1165
00:54:17,550 --> 00:54:19,967
MARK SNYDERMAN: And there's
all sorts of claims on a title

1166
00:54:19,967 --> 00:54:20,580
to property--

1167
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:23,900
somebody that fixed the
roof, or the utility company

1168
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:28,050
that has an easement through
the middle to put lines

1169
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:30,280
and so forth.

1170
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:33,450
So there are some
complications that

1171
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:37,090
are different than just
transferring money.

1172
00:54:37,090 --> 00:54:42,572
PROFESSOR: So to bring it
back, to broaden it out,

1173
00:54:42,572 --> 00:54:44,060
the que-- it's Rahim?

1174
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:44,927
AUDIENCE: Rahem.

1175
00:54:44,927 --> 00:54:45,635
PROFESSOR: Rahem.

1176
00:54:45,635 --> 00:54:47,760
Rahem's question
is, is, well, what

1177
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,680
about real estate and title?

1178
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:50,880
Might that be appropriate?

1179
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:55,350
And as Mark has given us a
sense of, yes, it might be.

1180
00:54:55,350 --> 00:54:58,620
But we're back to that sort of
thing of the collective action

1181
00:54:58,620 --> 00:55:01,680
issues that we've talked
about in previous classes--

1182
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:07,140
the collective action of
many municipal authorities

1183
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:10,485
that keep the land records, that
keep the real estate records.

1184
00:55:10,485 --> 00:55:15,120
Yeah, it might help, but
why do I need to do this?

1185
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,320
And it's also a [INAUDIBLE].

1186
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:20,740
It's a low volume,
low transaction.

1187
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:23,350
And yet, it could be
an enormous benefit,

1188
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:25,630
because there's something
called title insurance.

1189
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:28,090
And title insurance trying
to clean up the title

1190
00:55:28,090 --> 00:55:32,030
and making sure that
something is free and clear

1191
00:55:32,030 --> 00:55:35,520
could be recorded in the future.

1192
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,620
So I'll be a long-term optimist.

1193
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:40,410
I don't see this one being
solved in the next handful

1194
00:55:40,410 --> 00:55:42,480
of years-- single digit years--

1195
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,000
particularly because of the
[INAUDIBLE] collective action

1196
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:45,940
issues.

1197
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:46,440
I'm sorry.

1198
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:47,815
We have somebody
here who's going

1199
00:55:47,815 --> 00:55:52,990
to take the other side before I
give my conclusionary estimate.

1200
00:55:52,990 --> 00:55:53,490
Yes?

1201
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:54,030
AUDIENCE: Yes.

1202
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:55,113
That's exactly my startup.

1203
00:55:55,113 --> 00:55:59,055
The first phase is
collecting all the data

1204
00:55:59,055 --> 00:56:02,583
from all those munis
departmentals [INAUDIBLE]..

1205
00:56:02,583 --> 00:56:04,000
The information
is there publicly.

1206
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,820
So yes, they will not probably
immediately adopt a Corda node

1207
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:10,050
and record their stuff.

1208
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:13,860
But you can publicly
pool that information

1209
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:16,650
and then use that information
and record that information

1210
00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:17,770
on the blockchain.

1211
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:21,720
And then once I become
stronger and bigger,

1212
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,815
then they will probably
have to adopt it.

1213
00:56:23,815 --> 00:56:24,690
PROFESSOR: All right.

1214
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:25,850
[LAUGHTER]

1215
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:27,900
So maybe I'll move
up my estimate

1216
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:30,660
from double digit years
to single digit years.

1217
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:35,527
But I think it's going to be,
with all respect, some time.

1218
00:56:35,527 --> 00:56:36,860
Pria, then I'm going to move on.

1219
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:39,200
AUDIENCE: So I used
to work at Habitat

1220
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,530
for Humanity International.

1221
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:43,190
So access to proper
land rights or land

1222
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:45,590
title, that was a big
issue for us overseas,

1223
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:47,480
not so much in the US.

1224
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,400
And so I could see a
real application there,

1225
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:52,430
where in several countries
where there is no land record,

1226
00:56:52,430 --> 00:56:55,370
or there are no title
systems, or they're buried

1227
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:57,630
in layers of obfuscation.

1228
00:56:57,630 --> 00:56:59,990
This is a great solution
to get something

1229
00:56:59,990 --> 00:57:05,000
like that started in those
contexts, where there is--

1230
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,330
establishing the
property right of record

1231
00:57:08,330 --> 00:57:10,563
could be of immeasurable
social value.

1232
00:57:10,563 --> 00:57:12,350
PROFESSOR: You
know, I agree, and I

1233
00:57:12,350 --> 00:57:15,080
think there's been a
tremendous amount of literature

1234
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:18,840
in the last 24 months
around whether blockchain

1235
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:25,100
can help free up a lot of
illiquid capital and assets.

1236
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:30,350
I'm just saying I'm probably
closer to Mark's thinking

1237
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:31,928
than to Alon's thinking.

1238
00:57:31,928 --> 00:57:33,470
I think it's going
to take some time.

1239
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:35,330
AUDIENCE: But depending
on the context, right?

1240
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:35,997
In the context--

1241
00:57:35,997 --> 00:57:40,580
PROFESSOR: Context, the country,
the system, the legal system,

1242
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:44,150
how decentralized, and how
tough the collective action

1243
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:45,380
issues are.

1244
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:48,560
So just going back to
private blockchains,

1245
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:51,290
technical features--
let's go back.

1246
00:57:51,290 --> 00:57:55,790
Membership limited
to authorized nodes.

1247
00:57:55,790 --> 00:57:58,910
Transactions can be
partitioned as well.

1248
00:57:58,910 --> 00:58:00,260
It's kind of Kelly's point.

1249
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:04,040
Right in the technology, you
can partition and segregate

1250
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,300
information.

1251
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:07,760
So data and ledgers
can be partitioned

1252
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,090
because transactions
can be partitioned.

1253
00:58:11,090 --> 00:58:13,160
That doesn't mean you
can't have a layer 2.

1254
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:15,830
I'm just saying there's a
lot less need for a layer 2,

1255
00:58:15,830 --> 00:58:19,590
because they do it in the
data structures itself.

1256
00:58:19,590 --> 00:58:24,900
The consensus is permissioned
private protocols.

1257
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:26,310
They do have a consensus.

1258
00:58:26,310 --> 00:58:28,320
Somebody has to agree
on the next block.

1259
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:35,080
But it's a tight, limited group.

1260
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:38,260
It does use cryptography,
but often, there's

1261
00:58:38,260 --> 00:58:40,990
something called a
registration authority.

1262
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:46,690
The registration authority
is helping mask data.

1263
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:50,560
So they address
privacy two ways.

1264
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:53,830
They address privacy because
it's a smaller group.

1265
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:56,710
They can actually see
the whole network.

1266
00:58:56,710 --> 00:59:00,090
But even within the network,
even on the network,

1267
00:59:00,090 --> 00:59:03,890
they're further
addressing privacy

1268
00:59:03,890 --> 00:59:09,590
that Alpha's and my
transaction, Amanda maybe

1269
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:12,350
can't even see, even though
she's on the network,

1270
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:14,330
because it's encrypted.

1271
00:59:14,330 --> 00:59:16,670
And then there's sort of
what's called a registration

1272
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:23,910
authority, or authority within
the system, that can unmask it.

1273
00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:24,410
Yes.

1274
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:26,243
AUDIENCE: I just have
a question about the--

1275
00:59:26,243 --> 00:59:32,330
how is a segregated system a
subgroup of two [INAUDIBLE]

1276
00:59:32,330 --> 00:59:33,810
different from a layer?

1277
00:59:33,810 --> 00:59:37,520
If [INAUDIBLE] is already doing
subnetting off of calculations,

1278
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,500
or whatever it may
be-- transactions--

1279
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:42,015
and then the net [INAUDIBLE]--

1280
00:59:42,015 --> 00:59:42,890
PROFESSOR: All right.

1281
00:59:42,890 --> 00:59:45,057
So I've got another question
I have to follow up on.

1282
00:59:45,057 --> 00:59:47,810
I have to follow up on
Brotish's Corda question,

1283
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:50,030
and now James' question
about, well, wait a minute.

1284
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:53,368
How is this partitioning
different than a layer 2?

1285
00:59:53,368 --> 00:59:55,160
And it's beyond my
knowledge, but I'm going

1286
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:58,460
to see if I can get it for you.

1287
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:03,560
That's a good-- they're
both-- they're good questions.

1288
01:00:03,560 --> 01:00:07,460
And then smart contracts--
yes, smart contracts

1289
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:14,600
can happen on these systems as
well as permissionless systems.

1290
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:16,820
IBM-- they say
they use chaincode.

1291
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:20,570
But they say chaincode really
could be any language, at least

1292
01:00:20,570 --> 01:00:24,745
they advertise, and
no native currency.

1293
01:00:24,745 --> 01:00:26,120
So that's kind of
the technical--

1294
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:27,440
not deeply technical.

1295
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,120
It's not like learning
hash functions.

1296
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:32,360
But yes to cryptography.

1297
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:35,150
Well, they partition
the ledgers.

1298
01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:37,100
The consensus is closed loop.

1299
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:40,950
Yes, they have smart contracts.

1300
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:42,920
But they can even have
additional privacy.

1301
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:45,030
But it comes at a cost.

1302
01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:47,840
There's an authority
that has to protect

1303
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:51,900
something-- a registration
authority inside of it.

1304
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:53,310
Oh, I forgot.

1305
01:00:53,310 --> 01:00:54,870
The code is generally
open source.

1306
01:00:54,870 --> 01:00:56,700
It does not have
to be open source.

1307
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:59,430
Hyperledger is
open source, but it

1308
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:00,850
doesn't have to be open source.

1309
01:01:03,570 --> 01:01:06,030
So this was from
one of the readings.

1310
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:08,530
I'm just putting up that
chart that was in the reading.

1311
01:01:08,530 --> 01:01:09,960
And I just found it helpful.

1312
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:10,860
It's a different way.

1313
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:12,090
It's not Gensler's way.

1314
01:01:12,090 --> 01:01:14,660
It's somebody else's way
of thinking about Ethereum,

1315
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:16,870
Hyperledger, and Corda.

1316
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:18,480
I'm only using
Hyperledger and Corda

1317
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:22,170
because they're two of the
biggest private platforms.

1318
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:23,220
There are many others.

1319
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:28,600
Different programming
language-- you

1320
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:32,120
might say, from a business
point of view, who cares?

1321
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:35,810
And to some level,
you're probably right.

1322
01:01:35,810 --> 01:01:37,940
But you're not completely right.

1323
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:41,120
I mean, there's probably
more that people can write

1324
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:43,190
on top of Hyperledger Fabric.

1325
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:49,470
They say more developers could
work on that than Solidity.

1326
01:01:49,470 --> 01:01:52,760
Governance-- that's
the governance

1327
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:55,250
of the system itself.

1328
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:57,320
They all can do smart contracts.

1329
01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:00,110
We've talked about consensus.

1330
01:02:00,110 --> 01:02:02,740
And the scalability
is much harder.

1331
01:02:02,740 --> 01:02:05,870
Ethereum, remember, almost
crashed on CryptoKitties

1332
01:02:05,870 --> 01:02:08,220
last December.

1333
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:11,820
And I shared that story about
one initial coin offering

1334
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:15,900
was 30% of the Ethereum
network on the one day

1335
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:19,995
it was closing [INAUDIBLE].

1336
01:02:19,995 --> 01:02:25,190
DTCC, in a given day,
can do as much as 100

1337
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:28,960
million transactions in a day.

1338
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:33,820
That's the Depository
Trust Corporation.

1339
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:37,460
Ethereum does about a million
and a half transactions a day,

1340
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:42,040
and Bitcoin, about 400,000 to
500,000 transactions a day.

1341
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:49,120
So you know, we've still got a
ways to go on this scalability.

1342
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:51,340
So what about
traditional databases?

1343
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:53,800
I think that to talk
about permissioned

1344
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:56,780
versus permissionless,
a lot of people,

1345
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:58,540
even some of my
colleagues here at MIT,

1346
01:02:58,540 --> 01:03:01,430
says, well, if you're talking
about Hyperledger, Corda,

1347
01:03:01,430 --> 01:03:06,220
and Fabric and Corda,
that's like Oracle.

1348
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:08,350
That's just a
traditional database.

1349
01:03:08,350 --> 01:03:11,280
That's not really blockchain.

1350
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,390
The Bitcoin and
blockchain purist

1351
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:20,160
would say, if it doesn't have
Nakamoto consensus, forget it.

1352
01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:22,490
It's not a member of the club.

1353
01:03:22,490 --> 01:03:26,240
That's not how I've chosen
to teach that this class,

1354
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:27,710
as you know.

1355
01:03:27,710 --> 01:03:29,960
I think both are
relevant, possibly,

1356
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:32,750
to business solutions, and it's
worthwhile to think of them.

1357
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:35,950
But so what separates--

1358
01:03:35,950 --> 01:03:38,390
and this is not in the
reading, so I'm just going to,

1359
01:03:38,390 --> 01:03:39,800
you know, kind of--

1360
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:43,640
but what separates it versus
a traditional database?

1361
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:46,590
Well, back to the basics.

1362
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:50,160
Permissioned private blockchains
have append-only logs.

1363
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,320
You're adding-- I know.

1364
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:54,390
Thank you, Brotish.

1365
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:59,190
But basically, they
have append-only logs.

1366
01:03:59,190 --> 01:04:02,880
Traditional databases-- and I'm
at the edge of my knowledge--

1367
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:03,870
you can create.

1368
01:04:03,870 --> 01:04:04,710
You can read.

1369
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:05,550
You can update.

1370
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:08,263
You can delete.

1371
01:04:08,263 --> 01:04:12,490
Again, I'm taking the mainstream
traditional databases,

1372
01:04:12,490 --> 01:04:15,430
or what's called
CRUD, if you wish--

1373
01:04:15,430 --> 01:04:22,610
C-R-U-D. Whereas these,
you always are adding

1374
01:04:22,610 --> 01:04:25,010
to the database.

1375
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:28,790
Two, these databases
use cryptography

1376
01:04:28,790 --> 01:04:30,530
to have commitment schemes.

1377
01:04:30,530 --> 01:04:33,590
You may remember, what
is a hash function?

1378
01:04:33,590 --> 01:04:36,350
It not only compresses
data, but it means

1379
01:04:36,350 --> 01:04:39,430
you're committing to the data.

1380
01:04:39,430 --> 01:04:42,040
And when you finish The New
York Times crossword puzzle,

1381
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:43,960
you can actually send it in.

1382
01:04:43,960 --> 01:04:45,880
And if it's identical to--

1383
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:47,140
and hash it.

1384
01:04:47,140 --> 01:04:49,420
And if you remember our
discussion about The New York

1385
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:53,110
Times crossword puzzle, if it's
hashed, and the hashes match,

1386
01:04:53,110 --> 01:04:54,250
voilá.

1387
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:57,610
You solved The New York
Times crossword puzzle.

1388
01:04:57,610 --> 01:05:02,480
So you can have commitment
schemes for the data.

1389
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,190
And it can be distributed.

1390
01:05:04,190 --> 01:05:06,220
Yes, Joequinn.

1391
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:09,040
AUDIENCE: So even
if it's append-only,

1392
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:11,700
if you take away
the proof of work,

1393
01:05:11,700 --> 01:05:16,930
you can rewrite it in
a very quick manner.

1394
01:05:16,930 --> 01:05:19,700
PROFESSOR: So Joequinn's
raising a very important point.

1395
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:23,940
So even if it's append-only,
you get rid of proof of work,

1396
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:26,700
can't somebody go
in and rewrite it?

1397
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:33,480
Permissioned blockchains make
a different trade-off on trust.

1398
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:36,630
Permissionless system say,
we're going to address trust

1399
01:05:36,630 --> 01:05:38,850
through this proof of work.

1400
01:05:38,850 --> 01:05:42,480
And at least 51% of
all of the network

1401
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:46,370
has to, in essence, agree
and validate, and the like.

1402
01:05:46,370 --> 01:05:47,970
Permissioned
basically are saying,

1403
01:05:47,970 --> 01:05:53,780
I'm going to trust
the 10 or 15 or 20

1404
01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:58,750
nodes that are in the system
can validate against each other.

1405
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:03,980
And so there's something
about the club that's

1406
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:06,260
authorized in the network.

1407
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:08,390
But they're still
using append-only.

1408
01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:10,610
You're right that
within those 20,

1409
01:06:10,610 --> 01:06:13,250
somebody could try to
rush through and do

1410
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:16,190
a whole entire new append-only.

1411
01:06:16,190 --> 01:06:22,345
But then within the
club, it's exposed.

1412
01:06:22,345 --> 01:06:24,640
AUDIENCE: If the club
agrees that the last two

1413
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:29,110
days have to be rewritten, they
can do it in a very easy way.

1414
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:30,100
PROFESSOR: Correct.

1415
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:32,650
But I would contend
that even in Bitcoin,

1416
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:36,490
if 10,000 nodes decided to
rewrite the last two days,

1417
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:38,220
they could.

1418
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:38,720
It's a--

1419
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:41,265
AUDIENCE: Taken a lot of
time, because they have--

1420
01:06:41,265 --> 01:06:41,890
PROFESSOR: Yes.

1421
01:06:41,890 --> 01:06:42,837
AUDIENCE: --to find--

1422
01:06:42,837 --> 01:06:43,920
PROFESSOR: That's correct.

1423
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:44,580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

1424
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:45,663
PROFESSOR: That's correct.

1425
01:06:45,663 --> 01:06:47,940
So what Joequinn's
saying is in Bitcoin,

1426
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:51,270
what protects against that
is partly the proof of work,

1427
01:06:51,270 --> 01:06:55,320
and partly that it takes
10,000, or at least 51% of them,

1428
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:58,740
probably, to rewrite
the last two days.

1429
01:06:58,740 --> 01:07:00,690
The economic
incentives in Bitcoin

1430
01:07:00,690 --> 01:07:04,980
is, is why waste all your
computer power and electricity

1431
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:09,880
and so forth doing that when
you may as well just go forward?

1432
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:14,050
I think Bitcoin could be
susceptible to state actors.

1433
01:07:14,050 --> 01:07:17,010
I think, you know, if
North Korea wanted--

1434
01:07:17,010 --> 01:07:21,210
or Russia wanted-- to spend
probably single digit billions,

1435
01:07:21,210 --> 01:07:24,870
but at most maybe 10 billion,
they could overwhelm the whole

1436
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:27,270
system and bring--

1437
01:07:27,270 --> 01:07:29,790
they could do a 51%
attack by buying up

1438
01:07:29,790 --> 01:07:34,700
enough mining
equipment, the ASICs,

1439
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:37,850
and just bigfooting
the whole system.

1440
01:07:37,850 --> 01:07:40,800
But it's multiple billio-- and
there's academic papers on this

1441
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:41,300
now.

1442
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:42,920
It's single digit billions.

1443
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:45,740
A state actor could--

1444
01:07:45,740 --> 01:07:47,330
an individual wouldn't
want to do it,

1445
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:51,680
because you'd crush $110 billion
market cap down to [INAUDIBLE]..

1446
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:53,885
So that would be kind of unwise.

1447
01:07:57,860 --> 01:08:02,300
This is a very critical part
of what a private blockchain--

1448
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:04,850
to me, economically,
what a private blockchain

1449
01:08:04,850 --> 01:08:09,200
can do and facilitate better
than a traditional database.

1450
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,630
I'm not saying this
list is the only list.

1451
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:14,990
I'm not even saying this list
is completely the right list.

1452
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:17,600
This is Gary
Gensler's list trying

1453
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:20,600
to say, what's the
business that separates

1454
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:22,340
traditional blockchains?

1455
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:25,540
Append-only timestamping.

1456
01:08:25,540 --> 01:08:29,020
Some cryptography
and schemes that

1457
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:35,080
makes the data immutable so
you can put it in a ledger--

1458
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:37,630
so it's back to
ledgers and so forth--

1459
01:08:37,630 --> 01:08:40,069
and thus, finality
of settlement.

1460
01:08:40,069 --> 01:08:43,660
Does anybody want to remind the
class what settlement means?

1461
01:08:46,859 --> 01:08:47,510
Anybody?

1462
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:49,990
Take a shot.

1463
01:08:49,990 --> 01:08:52,147
Where's my accountant?

1464
01:08:52,147 --> 01:08:55,270
Aviva's not here.

1465
01:08:55,270 --> 01:08:56,150
Oh, please.

1466
01:08:58,705 --> 01:09:02,633
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
do with the UTXO.

1467
01:09:02,633 --> 01:09:04,970
PROFESSOR: No,
forget about UTXO.

1468
01:09:04,970 --> 01:09:06,859
Just tell me what
settlement means.

1469
01:09:06,859 --> 01:09:09,865
AUDIENCE: Oh, like, making
off your debit and credit.

1470
01:09:09,865 --> 01:09:12,229
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
debits and credits.

1471
01:09:12,229 --> 01:09:18,420
Settlement means changing
the data in a ledger,

1472
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:21,720
and doing it with finality.

1473
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:26,120
In essence, do I
have $10 or $11?

1474
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:30,569
A payment settlement system
is when you finally say,

1475
01:09:30,569 --> 01:09:33,390
I've got $11, no longer $10.

1476
01:09:33,390 --> 01:09:38,930
And Amanda's got
$9 instead of $10.

1477
01:09:38,930 --> 01:09:39,649
You went down.

1478
01:09:39,649 --> 01:09:40,409
I went up.

1479
01:09:40,409 --> 01:09:41,170
Is that all right?

1480
01:09:41,170 --> 01:09:42,050
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1481
01:09:42,050 --> 01:09:43,870
PROFESSOR: Thank you.

1482
01:09:43,870 --> 01:09:46,210
You'll hear a lot about
clearing and settlement.

1483
01:09:46,210 --> 01:09:48,880
The word settlement
means to finally change

1484
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:52,029
the data in a ledger,
and that we're not

1485
01:09:52,029 --> 01:09:53,830
going to come back to it.

1486
01:09:53,830 --> 01:09:54,750
It's done.

1487
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:56,680
It's final.

1488
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:58,600
If we're moving
something of value--

1489
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:01,580
and the value could be grapes.

1490
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:03,080
The value could be diamonds.

1491
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:04,490
The value can be real estate.

1492
01:10:04,490 --> 01:10:05,780
The value can be money.

1493
01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:08,000
But if we're moving
something of value

1494
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:16,440
and storing it on a ledger, it's
more adaptable to blockchain.

1495
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:18,960
If you're doing
some database that

1496
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:21,840
has nothing to do with
things of value and ledger,

1497
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:26,250
you don't need final
immutable settlement.

1498
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:28,530
I would contend you
probably have less reason

1499
01:10:28,530 --> 01:10:30,420
to use any of this
blockchain stuff.

1500
01:10:32,940 --> 01:10:33,610
Zan.

1501
01:10:33,610 --> 01:10:35,620
AUDIENCE: Can you
maybe talk a little bit

1502
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:38,050
about a real-world
implementation of this?

1503
01:10:38,050 --> 01:10:41,470
So I saw recently that Walmart
is forcing their suppliers

1504
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:45,840
to basically add themselves
into this private blockchain

1505
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:48,198
to basically track
their supply chain.

1506
01:10:48,198 --> 01:10:49,990
I'm having a really
hard time understanding

1507
01:10:49,990 --> 01:10:52,240
why that needs to
be on a blockchain,

1508
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:54,010
whether permissioned
or nonpermissioned,

1509
01:10:54,010 --> 01:10:56,920
and why that needs to be.

1510
01:10:56,920 --> 01:10:59,500
PROFESSOR: So the question
is, why is Walmart

1511
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:02,290
putting supply chain with a
bunch of agricultural products

1512
01:11:02,290 --> 01:11:03,910
on a blockchain?

1513
01:11:03,910 --> 01:11:08,255
Agricultural products
are something of value,

1514
01:11:08,255 --> 01:11:13,020
whether it's corn,
wheat, grapes.

1515
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:14,490
It's something of value.

1516
01:11:14,490 --> 01:11:18,700
And when it moves from one
owner to another owner,

1517
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:20,200
if you keep that
on a ledger, you

1518
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:23,350
can record that
Amanda has the grapes,

1519
01:11:23,350 --> 01:11:26,450
and Gary no longer
has the grapes.

1520
01:11:26,450 --> 01:11:31,770
And another thing that
blockchains help with

1521
01:11:31,770 --> 01:11:36,030
is they lower the cost of
reconciling multiple databases.

1522
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:39,780
We could keep-- as
in agriculture--

1523
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:44,280
we can keep separate
ledgers, separate databases.

1524
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:48,720
The farmers keeping
their database.

1525
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:50,970
The wholesaler with
the grain elevators

1526
01:11:50,970 --> 01:11:54,240
are keeping their database,
and up the supply chain,

1527
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:56,280
from the farm, to
the grain elevator,

1528
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:58,950
to the millers and
merchants, all the way

1529
01:11:58,950 --> 01:12:04,560
to General Mills, all the
way to Kroger and the store.

1530
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:08,400
Right now, those are multiple
databases that, by and large,

1531
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:10,470
don't have to communicate.

1532
01:12:10,470 --> 01:12:14,070
So the question is, will
Walmart get to the place

1533
01:12:14,070 --> 01:12:15,900
where that's a good idea?

1534
01:12:15,900 --> 01:12:22,030
But I'm just pointing out if
you're moving things of value

1535
01:12:22,030 --> 01:12:25,870
where you want to keep final
settlement that you know who

1536
01:12:25,870 --> 01:12:29,650
owns that thing of
value in ledgers,

1537
01:12:29,650 --> 01:12:33,620
and lastly, if you want to
lower any reconciliation--

1538
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:41,950
if you have multiple
ledgers and things of value,

1539
01:12:41,950 --> 01:12:47,170
blockchain, I think,
is more valuable.

1540
01:12:47,170 --> 01:12:49,448
Zan's asking, well,
is that Walmart?

1541
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:49,990
I don't know.

1542
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:51,090
We're going to find out.

1543
01:12:51,090 --> 01:12:53,148
Tom, and I've got about
seven minutes to finish.

1544
01:12:53,148 --> 01:12:54,690
AUDIENCE: There was
a talk last year.

1545
01:12:54,690 --> 01:12:57,070
Somebody [INAUDIBLE] came
in and talked about the--

1546
01:12:57,070 --> 01:12:59,050
they were then
piloting this program.

1547
01:12:59,050 --> 01:13:01,780
But the example they used
was, in E. coli outbreak

1548
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:05,830
in their spinach supply, rather
than taking a whole supplier,

1549
01:13:05,830 --> 01:13:08,050
an entire wholesaler
offline and recalling

1550
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:10,300
all of that product,
through the blockchain,

1551
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:12,760
they could trace it
to a particular farm

1552
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:16,030
and a single point of origin
almost instantaneously

1553
01:13:16,030 --> 01:13:18,352
and just take off a much
smaller portion of it.

1554
01:13:18,352 --> 01:13:19,560
PROFESSOR: So let me do this.

1555
01:13:19,560 --> 01:13:20,320
Let me just-- hold on.

1556
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:21,885
I know we've got
two questions here.

1557
01:13:21,885 --> 01:13:24,940
Let me just hold on, just
for-- is that all right?

1558
01:13:24,940 --> 01:13:25,440
All right.

1559
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:26,660
We got permission.

1560
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:30,140
So this was what we
talked about earlier--

1561
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:34,430
Coase's trade-offs of costs.

1562
01:13:34,430 --> 01:13:36,943
Let me try another
one, which is going

1563
01:13:36,943 --> 01:13:41,310
to be my shot at blockchains
and traditional databases.

1564
01:13:41,310 --> 01:13:43,980
So one is access control.

1565
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:45,870
Who has access to the ledger?

1566
01:13:45,870 --> 01:13:50,060
Who has access, if I
might, to the data?

1567
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:53,180
Three different types of
approaches we talked about--

1568
01:13:53,180 --> 01:13:56,420
open permissionless,
multiple permissioned,

1569
01:13:56,420 --> 01:13:57,410
and client server.

1570
01:13:57,410 --> 01:13:59,090
I'm using the word
client server just

1571
01:13:59,090 --> 01:14:01,190
to say traditional database.

1572
01:14:01,190 --> 01:14:03,200
You can use another words.

1573
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:06,530
But I'm just trying to say
three different types of data

1574
01:14:06,530 --> 01:14:07,340
structures.

1575
01:14:07,340 --> 01:14:09,410
And to Zan's question,
why would you

1576
01:14:09,410 --> 01:14:11,420
be in one bucket versus another?

1577
01:14:11,420 --> 01:14:12,710
And I'm saying this.

1578
01:14:12,710 --> 01:14:15,170
If you're a venture
capitalist one day,

1579
01:14:15,170 --> 01:14:18,890
and somebody comes in to you
with a blockchain solution,

1580
01:14:18,890 --> 01:14:20,600
this is the same thing.

1581
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:22,400
Hopefully, you'll
make it better.

1582
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:24,890
This is just my approach to it.

1583
01:14:24,890 --> 01:14:29,360
Public blockchain-- do
you need, basically,

1584
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:32,090
public write capability,
that lots of people

1585
01:14:32,090 --> 01:14:34,550
can write to these ledgers?

1586
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:36,230
Do you need that somewhere?

1587
01:14:36,230 --> 01:14:39,830
Secondly, do you want some peer
to peer transaction capability

1588
01:14:39,830 --> 01:14:44,040
across the distributed ledger?

1589
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:46,155
Do you kind of not want
any central intermediary?

1590
01:14:46,155 --> 01:14:48,030
Maybe you don't want
the central intermediary

1591
01:14:48,030 --> 01:14:49,650
because they're
slow and sluggish.

1592
01:14:49,650 --> 01:14:51,525
Maybe you don't want
the central intermediary

1593
01:14:51,525 --> 01:14:53,520
because they have a
lot of economic rents.

1594
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,590
It doesn't matter to me
why you want to get rid

1595
01:14:55,590 --> 01:14:57,072
of the central intermediary.

1596
01:14:57,072 --> 01:14:59,280
But if you want to get rid
of a central intermediary,

1597
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:02,630
or lessen their control,
or lower their control,

1598
01:15:02,630 --> 01:15:06,690
raise peer to peer transactions,
have a lot of public writing--

1599
01:15:06,690 --> 01:15:09,810
oh, and by the way, if you
want some token economics,

1600
01:15:09,810 --> 01:15:11,700
you're probably
somewhere over here.

1601
01:15:11,700 --> 01:15:13,620
I'm not saying you
have to have all four.

1602
01:15:13,620 --> 01:15:16,230
But to me, those are
the kind of three

1603
01:15:16,230 --> 01:15:18,360
or four things that
are floating around

1604
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:21,520
why you might be over there.

1605
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,860
Private blockchains--
well, maybe you actually

1606
01:15:23,860 --> 01:15:25,960
don't want public
write capability.

1607
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:27,050
You need private.

1608
01:15:27,050 --> 01:15:32,110
Whether it's just the Australian
Stock Exchange or 15 to 20 club

1609
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:36,670
deal, you still want kind
of multiple people to write,

1610
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:39,550
but you want it to be private.

1611
01:15:39,550 --> 01:15:46,670
But if you still need finality
of data and an append-only log,

1612
01:15:46,670 --> 01:15:48,990
that you need this appending--

1613
01:15:48,990 --> 01:15:53,090
the log, and you need
some public verifiability,

1614
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:55,880
that you still need that
data to be verified amongst--

1615
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:59,360
and this public means
15 or 20 players.

1616
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:02,280
But you need it to be
able to be verified--

1617
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:05,210
so the trust mechanism is
not thousands and open.

1618
01:16:05,210 --> 01:16:08,330
The trust mechanism is
15 or 20 or 5 parties.

1619
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:09,530
But you still need it--

1620
01:16:09,530 --> 01:16:11,600
you might be there.

1621
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:14,630
Where I come out is there's
some cases that you just

1622
01:16:14,630 --> 01:16:17,470
don't need any of this.

1623
01:16:17,470 --> 01:16:21,190
There's a trusted party
that hosts the data.

1624
01:16:21,190 --> 01:16:23,920
Your trust mechanism
is one party.

1625
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:25,570
The trusted party can do the--

1626
01:16:25,570 --> 01:16:27,460
I use the letters CRUD.

1627
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:36,390
That's the create, and update,
and delete, and so forth.

1628
01:16:36,390 --> 01:16:40,400
And that's based on client
service architecture,

1629
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:42,170
this client server architecture.

1630
01:16:42,170 --> 01:16:45,260
There's always, in that
circumstance, somebody right

1631
01:16:45,260 --> 01:16:49,250
in the middle that
basically owns,

1632
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:54,130
updates, governs that
whole architecture.

1633
01:16:54,130 --> 01:16:59,050
My business judgment
on this is if you're

1634
01:16:59,050 --> 01:17:03,620
moving things of value, you
want those things to value

1635
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:08,340
to have some final
settlement and immutability.

1636
01:17:08,340 --> 01:17:10,710
And immutability
append-only logs give you

1637
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:13,550
some of that final settlement.

1638
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:15,800
We talked very briefly
about a lawsuit

1639
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:19,690
that was 300 plus years ago--
the Crawford case in Scotland

1640
01:17:19,690 --> 01:17:22,340
that you won't have to remember.

1641
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:25,820
But this-- watch this.

1642
01:17:25,820 --> 01:17:27,380
So steal this from me.

1643
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:28,230
Just do me a favor.

1644
01:17:28,230 --> 01:17:29,070
Just steal it.

1645
01:17:29,070 --> 01:17:29,570
OK.

1646
01:17:29,570 --> 01:17:31,610
Right now, I have
a right of action.

1647
01:17:31,610 --> 01:17:34,310
But if you give it to-- who
are you going to give it to?

1648
01:17:34,310 --> 01:17:37,780
I don't have any
rights against you.

1649
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:38,870
No.

1650
01:17:38,870 --> 01:17:39,380
Well, wait.

1651
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:42,020
It depends whether he
knew you stole it from me.

1652
01:17:42,020 --> 01:17:45,270
But it's gone.

1653
01:17:45,270 --> 01:17:47,670
That's final settlement.

1654
01:17:47,670 --> 01:17:50,250
Those $2 are gone.

1655
01:17:50,250 --> 01:17:51,930
That's final settlement.

1656
01:17:51,930 --> 01:17:52,770
It's immutable.

1657
01:17:52,770 --> 01:17:54,270
I can't get them back.

1658
01:17:54,270 --> 01:17:55,050
What, Christopher?

1659
01:17:55,050 --> 01:17:55,820
You want them?

1660
01:17:55,820 --> 01:17:57,570
AUDIENCE: I just was
asking for the money.

1661
01:17:57,570 --> 01:17:59,550
PROFESSOR: You were
asking for the money.

1662
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:02,580
I just use that as
a visualization.

1663
01:18:02,580 --> 01:18:06,780
Money is a social consensus
and a social construct.

1664
01:18:06,780 --> 01:18:08,910
But if you think of it
in terms of ledgers--

1665
01:18:08,910 --> 01:18:09,900
look, the money's gone.

1666
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:10,890
I can't get it.

1667
01:18:10,890 --> 01:18:12,570
That's it, you know?

1668
01:18:12,570 --> 01:18:13,470
That's good.

1669
01:18:13,470 --> 01:18:16,340
You all go to Sloan, I can tell.

1670
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:18,600
Yeah, yeah.

1671
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:20,490
But it's an important concept.

1672
01:18:20,490 --> 01:18:22,750
I think of this whole that way.

1673
01:18:22,750 --> 01:18:24,870
So there were two
questions, and then we'll--

1674
01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:27,150
and then this is the
decentralized end.

1675
01:18:27,150 --> 01:18:30,330
Bitcoin and Ethereum are kind
of at the decentralized end.

1676
01:18:30,330 --> 01:18:34,160
I would contend Bitcoin's more
decentralized than Ethereum.

1677
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:37,610
And centralized databases--
initial coin offerings

1678
01:18:37,610 --> 01:18:39,170
that we'll talk
about later, I think,

1679
01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:40,670
are actually maybe
a little bit more

1680
01:18:40,670 --> 01:18:42,920
centralized, even, than
permissioned blockchains.

1681
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:45,140
But we'll get to that.

1682
01:18:45,140 --> 01:18:46,970
AUDIENCE: No, mine
was already answered.

1683
01:18:46,970 --> 01:18:48,428
And then the other
comment was more

1684
01:18:48,428 --> 01:18:49,640
about the supply chain link.

1685
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:51,557
When you think about the
millions and millions

1686
01:18:51,557 --> 01:18:54,160
of dollars, the
element of transparency

1687
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:56,930
that blockchain kind of
brings in to all the parties

1688
01:18:56,930 --> 01:18:59,570
probably saves an
insane amount of money

1689
01:18:59,570 --> 01:19:01,950
to what you're talking
about kind of reconciling

1690
01:19:01,950 --> 01:19:04,470
all the databases.

1691
01:19:04,470 --> 01:19:08,650
PROFESSOR: So
we're going to talk

1692
01:19:08,650 --> 01:19:12,400
about finance next Thursday
and some of the strengths

1693
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:14,902
and weaknesses in finance,
and some of the attributes,

1694
01:19:14,902 --> 01:19:16,360
and you know, one
of the readings--

1695
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:17,950
Sheila Bair-- and
there's a bunch

1696
01:19:17,950 --> 01:19:20,050
of optional readings
about what's

1697
01:19:20,050 --> 01:19:23,108
happened after the financial
crisis and so forth.

1698
01:19:23,108 --> 01:19:25,150
And then we're going to
talk about the economics.

1699
01:19:25,150 --> 01:19:28,840
But I've had three or four
groups come in already talking

1700
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:30,030
about the final projects.

1701
01:19:30,030 --> 01:19:32,680
So I'll just say, think
about whatever you're working

1702
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:35,950
on as this new
technology-- blockchain--

1703
01:19:35,950 --> 01:19:38,590
whether it's permissioned
or permissionless--

1704
01:19:38,590 --> 01:19:42,820
either one-- does this new
technology really address some

1705
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:46,450
pain point that you're
trying to solve,

1706
01:19:46,450 --> 01:19:50,220
whether it's about
payment systems or--

1707
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:52,500
actually, there's a group
that's talking about doing

1708
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:55,730
supply chain on wine.

1709
01:19:55,730 --> 01:19:56,930
And I figured, why not?

1710
01:19:56,930 --> 01:19:58,070
I'll probably approve it.

1711
01:20:01,310 --> 01:20:04,940
But it's, what is the pain
point that you're actually

1712
01:20:04,940 --> 01:20:07,320
trying to solve?

1713
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:11,070
Or will decentralized
peer to peer networking

1714
01:20:11,070 --> 01:20:15,000
somehow create a business
opportunity in a new model?

1715
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,390
It might not be a pain point.

1716
01:20:16,390 --> 01:20:18,330
It might be a
business opportunity

1717
01:20:18,330 --> 01:20:22,620
that decentralized
systems solve.

1718
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:25,380
Or it might be an opportunity
that token economics

1719
01:20:25,380 --> 01:20:27,430
can help solve.

1720
01:20:27,430 --> 01:20:30,400
But if there's no pain
point you're solving,

1721
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:36,390
no token economics, no
decentralization peer to peer,

1722
01:20:36,390 --> 01:20:38,280
I ask you to use your
critical reasoning

1723
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:41,940
and move to the next use
case, because this is really

1724
01:20:41,940 --> 01:20:44,460
about-- this is
a business class.

1725
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:47,640
This is about finding places
for this incredible set

1726
01:20:47,640 --> 01:20:52,745
of new technologies in
the context of markets

1727
01:20:52,745 --> 01:20:57,720
and to have a really
healthy sense of ground

1728
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:00,600
truth about what's possible.

1729
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:02,670
If not, traditional databases.

1730
01:21:02,670 --> 01:21:03,810
Move on.

1731
01:21:03,810 --> 01:21:05,880
I'm not looking for
projects at the end

1732
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:09,670
of the semester that are
using traditional databases.

1733
01:21:09,670 --> 01:21:12,000
It's got to really
use blockchain.

1734
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,330
So I thank you.

1735
01:21:13,330 --> 01:21:15,380
I'll see you next Thursday.
