00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,790
GARY GENSLER:
Today's a little bit

9
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:31,010
of a discussion about clearing
and settlement systems.

10
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:32,720
Maybe you feel you've
heard everything

11
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,270
you needed from Jeff
Sprecher when he was asked

12
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,340
a question when he was with us.

13
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,180
Jeff runs some of
the largest clearing

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,860
houses in the world at
Intercontinental Exchange

15
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:47,660
not only because he started
in the energy business,

16
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:51,650
but he has big credit default
swap clearing houses and energy

17
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,630
clearing houses and the like.

18
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:57,740
And he said, well, I don't know
about blockchain technology

19
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:58,910
for clearing and settling.

20
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:02,180
But I'm going to try this
Bitcoin project that you all

21
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,800
know about and he talked about.

22
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,277
But today we're going
to try to dig into,

23
00:01:06,277 --> 00:01:08,360
well, maybe there's something
there, because there

24
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,010
are projects going on.

25
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,380
And why are there projects?

26
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:16,580
They're mostly permissioned
and not permissionless systems.

27
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,160
But I think there's
something there.

28
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,560
This will be one of
the more optimistic--

29
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,120
if you're judging how often
I get to the maximal side,

30
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,540
I think there is probably
something there, at least

31
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,420
for permissioned blockchain
projects in the clearing

32
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,940
and settling.

33
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:38,270
I'm going to-- we'll, of
course, go through the readings.

34
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:41,060
And these are the sort of
topics we'll go through.

35
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,010
Clearing and settling services--

36
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:47,330
I'm going to try to set this
stage as to what this is.

37
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:50,210
Frankly, when I was on
Wall Street for 18 years,

38
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:53,210
I couldn't really define
what clearing and settling.

39
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:53,960
Sorry, Ross.

40
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,950
You thought I could define
it when I was on Wall Street?

41
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:57,790
What's that?

42
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:59,570
AUDIENCE: I just strictly know
someone else can't either.

43
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,362
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

44
00:02:00,362 --> 00:02:00,872
Yeah.

45
00:02:00,872 --> 00:02:03,080
Well, when you're in the
merger and acquisition area,

46
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,910
you usually don't
think about what

47
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,657
it means to clear
something and to settle it.

48
00:02:07,657 --> 00:02:09,199
And frankly, even
usually when you're

49
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,110
on the trading floor, that's
something somebody else

50
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,840
takes care of.

51
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,580
Just the nature of--

52
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,470
how many people have worked
on trading floors here?

53
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:20,970
All right.

54
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,850
So I'm going to have seven
or eight of you start.

55
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:26,310
And you're on notice now.

56
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,490
In about eight to 10 minutes,
you're going to help.

57
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:34,147
You might prove what I just said
to Ross, that you can't define

58
00:02:34,147 --> 00:02:36,480
what clearing and settling
is because somebody else took

59
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,100
care of it.

60
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,400
But we'll see.

61
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,140
We'll see.

62
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,450
And then we'll talk about
blockchain technology

63
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,060
applicability, some of the
projects that are going on,

64
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,330
and then move over to this.

65
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,135
There was a reading from
the International Swaps

66
00:02:51,135 --> 00:02:54,600
and Derivatives
Association, ISDA,

67
00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:00,090
what they're doing around
smart contracts in this space.

68
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:02,613
But what I want to do
first is a little bit

69
00:03:02,613 --> 00:03:04,530
of talking about final
projects, because we're

70
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:06,120
at that time of the year.

71
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,420
And this is to help.

72
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,990
Then I'm going to go through
eight or nine questions.

73
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:17,280
If you haven't already
thought through your projects,

74
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,690
these are eight
or nine questions

75
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:22,740
that I would think you'd
want to think about,

76
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,810
which is another way of
saying it will probably

77
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:28,260
enhance your performance.

78
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,530
What else can I say?

79
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:34,260
And number one-- and it's
a little, small print.

80
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:34,890
I'm sorry.

81
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:37,110
Or no, it's not too bad--

82
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,340
is what's the value creation
proposition, or pain point,

83
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,100
if you wish.

84
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,070
So are you creating value?

85
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:45,428
Are you solving a pain point?

86
00:03:45,428 --> 00:03:47,220
Or as Jeff Sprecher
would say, what are you

87
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:51,880
doing that's going to make
something cheaper, faster,

88
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,610
better?

89
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:55,470
What's the value proposition?

90
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,880
Whatever space.

91
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,320
There's two or three groups
that are doing trade finance.

92
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,220
There's one or two
doing payments.

93
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,990
There's some group
doing commercial--

94
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:11,470
I mean, consumer credit
rating or so forth.

95
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,942
There's a wide variety.

96
00:04:12,942 --> 00:04:14,400
There's one or two
groups that have

97
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,209
come to see me that are doing
things outside of finance.

98
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:22,660
But regardless, what's
the value proposition?

99
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,170
What pain points
are you addressing?

100
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,900
Or as Jeff would say,
what are you going

101
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,000
to do better, faster, cheaper?

102
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,960
If you can't answer
that threshold question,

103
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,820
shake it loose.

104
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,350
Kick it around.

105
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:42,270
Or move on to a different
use case, frankly.

106
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,950
Secondly, [INAUDIBLE]
you get into,

107
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,170
like, what is this
blockchain technology?

108
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:50,610
What transactions or data
is going to be recorded?

109
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:52,650
Because this is
fundamentally, ultimately,

110
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:57,130
a database technology, even
the permissionless systems.

111
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,210
And you'll see a later
question is why this versus

112
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,860
traditional database system?

113
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,810
But what transactions,
what data--

114
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,880
whether it's health
care records,

115
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,260
whether it's consumer
credit data, supply chain,

116
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,350
moving a piece of property
along a supply chain,

117
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:16,230
but what is the actual data
and transactions that you're

118
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,550
recording?

119
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,820
Questions?

120
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,510
What multiple stakeholders
need to write and read access

121
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,590
to the ledgers?

122
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,390
And I underline
the word multiple.

123
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:30,080
Because really, when you think
about the value proposition

124
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,950
of blockchain technology,
it's about immutable records,

125
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:38,180
or so-called immutable records.

126
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,630
That's verifiable,
immutable records

127
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:45,090
amongst multiple parties.

128
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,560
And it cost extra money.

129
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,710
Everything we've been studying
about in this semester

130
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:51,330
is about there's
more complexity.

131
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:55,290
There's more cost, in some
way, of this decentralized,

132
00:05:55,290 --> 00:06:00,300
even permissioned systems,
decentralized system.

133
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,100
But you get something for it.

134
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:06,100
You get some verification
of transactions, of data,

135
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:08,070
of mutability.

136
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,800
But you also have
to have some logic

137
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,420
that there's
multiple parties that

138
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:15,600
need to both write and read.

139
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,390
A distributed database
that just does read only--

140
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:23,290
I can read my Bank of
America bank account.

141
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:26,230
I can see what's in
that sort of ledger.

142
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:28,180
It doesn't have to
be on a blockchain.

143
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,720
So multiple parties writing,
why is that important?

144
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,700
Forming consensus,
in this circumstance.

145
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,610
Which specific cost of
verification or networking

146
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:40,510
are you lowering?

147
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:43,780
We talked about a lot of
the verification costs,

148
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:47,350
whether it's privacy,
censorship resistance,

149
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,258
whether it's some direct cost.

150
00:06:49,258 --> 00:06:50,800
Maybe you're going
right at something

151
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,590
that's got a bunch of
economic rents in it.

152
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,750
So there was a series
of verification costs

153
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,460
we talked about.

154
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:00,490
What networking costs
are you trying to reduce?

155
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,430
There's probably been
something in the order

156
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:11,470
of 4,000 or 5,000 white
papers, many that you can find.

157
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,062
You can't find all of them.

158
00:07:13,062 --> 00:07:14,770
But if you're going
at something that you

159
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,660
think a white paper
has been written about

160
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,240
or a blockchain company
has been started on,

161
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,080
figure out what the
competition is doing.

162
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,920
And for the two groups,
and it may be more,

163
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,620
that are doing something around
trade, finance, and supply

164
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,730
chain, you know there's a
bunch of stuff you can read.

165
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:32,260
We'll be studying
it next Tuesday.

166
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:32,973
Alin?

167
00:07:32,973 --> 00:07:35,390
AUDIENCE: Can you give us an
example of a networking cost?

168
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,670
I'm not sure what that is.

169
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:40,690
GARY GENSLER: So
networking cost is often

170
00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:44,170
why people are using
a native token.

171
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:50,730
But networking costs are
how to jumpstart a network.

172
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:54,270
Uber jumpstarted a
network, in a sense,

173
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,850
without blockchain technology.

174
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,750
But an example of
networking costs

175
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,200
are if you walked
out of the airport

176
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,790
and you didn't think any drivers
are using this application,

177
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:08,480
then you wouldn't be terribly
interested in using it.

178
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,720
So--

179
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,860
AUDIENCE: But who
incurs the cost?

180
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:16,760
GARY GENSLER: Often the cost
of building a network can

181
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,860
be a tremendous startup cost.

182
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,052
So how to start a
network often is

183
00:08:22,052 --> 00:08:23,760
you go to a bunch of
venture capitalists.

184
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,010
You raise money.

185
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,600
You advertise.

186
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,430
And you try to get participants.

187
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:32,900
And one of the challenges
of health care records--

188
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,990
we don't have our health
care experts in here today.

189
00:08:39,825 --> 00:08:40,700
I was looking around.

190
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:44,240
We have two students from
Harvard's public policy

191
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,170
school doing graduate work
and sometimes join us.

192
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,460
But health care
records, for instance,

193
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:54,650
there's some really interesting
blockchain technology

194
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,070
solutions.

195
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:57,920
But the networking
challenge is how do you

196
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,500
get a bunch of medical
providers, hospitals, doctors,

197
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,350
and users to actually
join the network.

198
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:09,230
So that would be an
example of network cost

199
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,395
is basically adoption often.

200
00:09:11,395 --> 00:09:12,020
Does that help?

201
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:12,645
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

202
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,730
GARY GENSLER: What are
the competitors doing?

203
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,380
I'm not looking for plagiarism.

204
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,580
But if you're in a space,
payments or supply chain

205
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,130
or consumer credit
or some others,

206
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:29,010
where there's three or six
or 10 white papers out there

207
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,680
and maybe somebody has
even raised 20 million

208
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:37,050
or a couple million in an ICO,
then it would be interesting.

209
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,730
You should feel free
to look at those.

210
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,470
And maybe you'll
be informed by it.

211
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,220
And you'll say, yeah,
I'm doing it better.

212
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,550
Or they've got it poorly here.

213
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,070
Or their project's in Estonia.

214
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:50,730
And I'm going to do a
digital ID project in the US.

215
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:54,240
And our regulatory system
is different than Estonia.

216
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,060
But I wouldn't be bashful about
looking at the competition.

217
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,400
In fact, I would say that's--

218
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,400
we're a business school.

219
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,130
You always look at
the competition.

220
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:05,040
And you see if you can do
either what they're doing better

221
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,140
or what they're doing
in a different geography

222
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,500
or in a little bit
different market.

223
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,750
Back to how Alin likes
to define things,

224
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:14,660
I've not used the term
blockchain technology yet

225
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:17,120
on this slide, have I?

226
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,940
But why are append-only logs
at multiple party consensus

227
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,780
the best solution?

228
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,730
Which kind of goes
back to why not just

229
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:28,960
a traditional database.

230
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:34,390
But why append-only,
timestamped, verifiable logs?

231
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:37,420
They're connected by
cryptographic hash functions.

232
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,790
But why have these logs?

233
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,770
And why have multiple
parties in essence

234
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:46,665
form a consensus about
the state of the ledger?

235
00:10:46,665 --> 00:10:47,307
Alin?

236
00:10:47,307 --> 00:10:47,890
AUDIENCE: Yes.

237
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:51,590
I have a question about the
timestamped, apend-only logs.

238
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:54,420
Is that only relevant
in blockchain,

239
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,210
that traditional
databases do not

240
00:10:56,210 --> 00:11:01,740
have these kinds of features,
timestamp and append-only logs?

241
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,740
GARY GENSLER: They
can have time--

242
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,690
timestamps in essence.

243
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:11,130
In essence, it's innovation
of the early '90s.

244
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:13,070
And then Satoshi
Nakamoto grabbed it.

245
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:16,520
It was the concept that
you take a block of data

246
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,120
and you connect it to the next
block with a cryptographic hash

247
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,862
function.

248
00:11:20,862 --> 00:11:22,820
And once you've done
that, then it's committed.

249
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,050
You can't amend
anything that's before

250
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:29,460
because it's a unique hash.

251
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:33,880
And traditional databases did
not have similar commitment

252
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,380
schemes.

253
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,360
They do have other
commitments schemes, but not

254
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,720
this commitment scheme of
taking a block of data,

255
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,700
having the hash function,
which then means never shall

256
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,520
you amend what came before.

257
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,960
That's how I understand it.

258
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,295
Did you have a different view
on traditional databases?

259
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,670
AUDIENCE: Well,
I guess this gets

260
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,620
to the root of the question.

261
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,510
Is there something new
about blockchain technology?

262
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,050
In my opinion, there
isn't, actually.

263
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:06,140
20 years ago, we knew how to
make a traditional database

264
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:09,380
and make it full of power and
make it a census protocol,

265
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,497
or what people nowadays like to
call a permissioned blockchain.

266
00:12:12,497 --> 00:12:13,580
So we knew how to do that.

267
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,372
And that would give
you an append-only log.

268
00:12:15,372 --> 00:12:18,820
It's nothing exceptional.

269
00:12:21,808 --> 00:12:22,600
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

270
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,800
So there are debates as to
where is the border and boundary

271
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,420
between a permissioned
blockchain

272
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,190
and a traditional database.

273
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:35,210
But I've chosen to, at
least for this class,

274
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:39,890
a hyperledger fabric, we'll
call that a blockchain project.

275
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:43,970
But recognize there are some
who would say, well, that's--

276
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:48,610
unless you have a native token,
it's not really blockchain.

277
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:49,275
Eric.

278
00:12:49,275 --> 00:12:56,330
AUDIENCE: --one could call point
recent days that the trust is

279
00:12:56,330 --> 00:13:00,760
the key attribute that's not
the factor in this equation,

280
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,290
because you can get a multiple--

281
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:08,950
I mean, multiple party consensus
doesn't have value on its own.

282
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:12,760
It's actually multiple
party consensus is--

283
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:17,140
it's actually something you had
to come up as a necessity that

284
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,150
stems from the fact
that you're dealing

285
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:22,960
with a decentralized arrangement
in which you're not trusting

286
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,940
any of the parties
that intervening

287
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,790
in the exchange of information.

288
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,620
Right?

289
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,020
GARY GENSLER: Well, I
agree with the first half,

290
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:36,130
that you wouldn't even
want to use Hyperledger

291
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:39,880
Fabric unless you really
need multiple parties writing

292
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:40,870
to the ledger.

293
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:43,990
And I think that does
separate it a little bit.

294
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,860
You could take an
Oracle database

295
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,340
and allow it to be
multiple parties, too.

296
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:51,130
But I think that separates it.

297
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:57,220
You might be more the
purist than I am, Eric.

298
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:02,220
I don't think it has to
be completely open, where

299
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,710
you don't know all
the participants.

300
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,600
But even in a
financial-- we'll talk

301
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,090
about the Australian
Stock Exchange

302
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:12,630
in a half an hour or so.

303
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:17,230
And when we talk about that,
that's a limited closed loop.

304
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,060
But they believe that
they are actually

305
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,083
taking a lot of cost out
of the verification side.

306
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,500
They think they're
getting a lot--

307
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,750
they're lowering
verification costs.

308
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,150
And they would contend they're
lowering networking costs,

309
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,490
because they don't have
the same reconciliations

310
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:33,550
between multiple databases.

311
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,590
Now, you might call
that verification cost.

312
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:37,630
But I think they would
call it both verification

313
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:40,140
and networking cost.

314
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:43,390
There's multiple back offices
no longer reconciling.

315
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:51,010
If your final project has
a permissionless system

316
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:54,160
with a native token, why
do you need a native token?

317
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,450
Is it to jumpstart the ICO that
you want to raise money for?

318
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,520
I'm not averse to that.

319
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:04,000
But at least fess up
and say that's how

320
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,950
we're crowdsourcing this thing.

321
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:08,250
If it's about that
you really believe

322
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:12,130
there's some benefit
to the token economics,

323
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:16,660
that it's an incentive system
to run your new competition

324
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:20,230
to Uber or an incentive
system for health care records

325
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:23,470
or an incentive system
for supply chain,

326
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:26,810
talk about what that
incentive system is.

327
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:30,280
And are you trying to motivate
jumpstarting the network

328
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:33,210
or maintaining
the network later?

329
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:35,308
And it could be both.

330
00:15:35,308 --> 00:15:36,100
It could be either.

331
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,770
I'm just saying it would be
good to have a discussion.

332
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:43,350
Is the native token
just about crowdfunding?

333
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,930
Is the native token
also about jumpstarting

334
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:47,580
this network and
then an incentive

335
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,580
to maintain the network
amongst multiple parties?

336
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:57,780
What trade-offs of scalability,
performance, privacy, security,

337
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,620
coordination?

338
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,510
I'm not asking
you to solve that.

339
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:03,600
And in fact, you can even jump
ahead three and five and seven

340
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,240
years and assume that
some of these things

341
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,980
will be taken care of.

342
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:13,110
So recognize that in the
permissioned blockchains,

343
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,420
they seem to have a
higher performance, a lot

344
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:18,700
higher performance, than the
native token permissionless

345
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,630
systems.

346
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:23,940
But if you're proposing a native
token permissionless system,

347
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,510
I'd just like a short
discussion of how much

348
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:32,460
these scalability issues matter
to you, particularly when

349
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,280
most of the native token
permissionless systems

350
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,920
can't handle much
more than 1,000

351
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,980
or a handful 1,000 of
transactions a day.

352
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,740
It is true that Bitcoin handles
quite a bit more than that.

353
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:49,200
But five or 10
transactions a second,

354
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,720
is that going to work for
whatever your solution is?

355
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,980
In fact, I'd like to see some
groups use native tokens.

356
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,010
I want to have a variety of
things I read in December

357
00:17:01,010 --> 00:17:02,860
rather than reading
all permission systems.

358
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:11,170
And then again, can a
permissioned blockchain

359
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,920
or traditional
database adequately

360
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,839
address whatever
use case if you do

361
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:17,030
have a permissionless system?

362
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:22,119
Thinking about that, how can
broad adoption be realized?

363
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:24,619
Are you going to use a native
token to equip broad adoption?

364
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:26,952
How are you going to get a
bunch of hospitals signed on?

365
00:17:26,952 --> 00:17:29,200
How are you going to get a
bunch of banks signed on?

366
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,908
You're going to do
like Jeff Sprecher did

367
00:17:30,908 --> 00:17:33,428
and give 50% of his equity away.

368
00:17:33,428 --> 00:17:34,970
There was that
conversation he talked

369
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,280
about he had with Goldman
Sachs, that he realized

370
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,070
that was the only way to
get his business started

371
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:43,130
in the late 1990s.

372
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:48,590
But just how are you going
to get that adoption?

373
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:51,260
And to the extent, this
might be a paragraph,

374
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,410
but what type of customer
interface or how might it be

375
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:57,518
better than other customer UIs?

376
00:17:57,518 --> 00:17:59,060
So these are just
some of the things,

377
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:02,060
if you were thinking
about a real business.

378
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:05,510
And I think that the
market is moving away

379
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:08,750
from that big,
frothy bull market,

380
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:12,020
where there was as many as
400 or 500 ICOs a month.

381
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:15,330
And it was raising anywhere
from 2 to 5 billion a month.

382
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,200
October was about 200 ICOs.

383
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,790
And it was about 800 million.

384
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:25,220
And I think it's going
to continue to decline,

385
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:28,165
partly because they
don't all work.

386
00:18:28,165 --> 00:18:29,540
But partly because
people are now

387
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:34,560
getting more rigorous as
to what's really going on.

388
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,687
If you are using a
permissioned blockchain,

389
00:18:36,687 --> 00:18:38,270
you don't have to
tell me whether it's

390
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:39,388
Hyperledger or Corda.

391
00:18:39,388 --> 00:18:41,180
But if somebody does
and you have something

392
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,570
thoughtful to say there,
I'm intrigued to find out

393
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:47,300
why this one versus that one.

394
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,180
It's really just to show
your critical analysis

395
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,810
of this subject.

396
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:53,570
And if you want
to prove yourself

397
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:57,020
on why it's Corda versus
Hyperledger Fabric,

398
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,880
that'll be interesting if
somebody has a point of view.

399
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,440
But I'm not looking for that
level of either computer

400
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,620
science knowledge.

401
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,360
This is from a
business perspective.

402
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,170
Think of me as a
venture capitalist.

403
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:14,820
If I was investing, how
you pull it together.

404
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,270
So any questions on that?

405
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,890
So we had six or
seven people that

406
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,440
actually worked in banking.

407
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,792
Who did we have at this table?

408
00:19:24,792 --> 00:19:26,258
Ah.

409
00:19:26,258 --> 00:19:27,050
So what's clearing?

410
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,110
AUDIENCE: If I
recall correctly, you

411
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:37,230
need to prove the identity
of the other party

412
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,640
in order to make sure
that you're sending

413
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,640
the asset to the right--

414
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:40,920
GARY GENSLER: All right.

415
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,580
So you have to
prove the identity.

416
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:46,140
So it's about validating and
authenticating an identity.

417
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,730
Anything else in clearing?

418
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,270
Who else worked in trading?

419
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:52,110
I had somebody back at
the back table worked in--

420
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:52,646
ah.

421
00:19:52,646 --> 00:19:55,830
AUDIENCE: Is it that they
have the assets to be traded?

422
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:57,840
GARY GENSLER: They have
the assets to be traded.

423
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,770
Well, most equity markets
trade on transaction date

424
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:04,560
plus two days.

425
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,720
So somewhere in
that two days, you

426
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,820
have to confirm
they have the asset.

427
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,730
That is correct.

428
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:12,000
You don't have to do
it on t plus zero,

429
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,380
normally by t plus 1.

430
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,240
AUDIENCE: I think--

431
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:15,990
I could be wrong.

432
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:19,050
But I think you had to do
as well would be the stock

433
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:21,380
exchange knowing what is
the net exposure that you

434
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,380
have at the [INAUDIBLE].

435
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,240
GARY GENSLER: Net exposure.

436
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,140
Net exposure.

437
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,110
Very key thing.

438
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,480
So there's authentication.

439
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,130
At some point between
execution and transaction,

440
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:35,100
you have to actually know
you have the security--

441
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:39,260
and then net exposure,
which we're going

442
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,850
to look at on another page.

443
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:45,900
This simple chart of two
people cutting the lawns,

444
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,330
but a buyer and seller meet.

445
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,500
But a buyer and seller
meet in an exchange

446
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,950
in traditional securities
markets through brokers.

447
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:59,360
That's called an
inner mediated access.

448
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,323
In the crypto exchange
markets, those two brokers

449
00:21:04,323 --> 00:21:06,240
on the left-hand side
and the right-hand side,

450
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,495
the sellers and buyers
brokers, don't exist.

451
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,480
In the crypto exchange
markets, basically you

452
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:20,980
have direct access
to the market.

453
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,710
But in the traditional
stock exchanges,

454
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:26,025
whether it's London,
Tokyo, New York, Beijing--

455
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,982
where's the exchange in India?

456
00:21:32,982 --> 00:21:34,370
AUDIENCE: Mumbai.

457
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:36,720
GARY GENSLER: Oh,
it's at Mumbai now?

458
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,590
I forgot.

459
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:40,460
30 years ago, I visited it
and walked on the floor.

460
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,990
It was called the Bombay
Stock Exchange back then.

461
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:46,440
But regardless of where
the stock exchange is,

462
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,320
there's some clearing house
separate from the stock

463
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:54,490
exchange doing these functions
that we just talked about.

464
00:21:54,490 --> 00:22:00,240
So three steps-- execution.

465
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,988
What's it mean to
execute a trade?

466
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:03,780
Alpha, do you know what
it means to execute

467
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,652
a trade without reading?

468
00:22:05,652 --> 00:22:06,360
Should I go back?

469
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:06,985
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

470
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,710
Because I've traded before.

471
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:11,730
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

472
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:12,900
That's why I called on you.

473
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,400
AUDIENCE: We did a great job
with a separate execution team.

474
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,670
That helped us with that.

475
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:21,990
But signing the docs,
making sure that the account

476
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:24,470
information is all there, if
it's been done through NSDA.

477
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:25,470
GARY GENSLER: All right.

478
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,740
So this sounds like it's
about derivatives, executing

479
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,730
a derivatives contract.

480
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:33,610
But what if you're just buying
100 shares of Apple stock?

481
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:36,435
What's it mean to
execute a trade?

482
00:22:36,435 --> 00:22:38,310
AUDIENCE: To be on the
phone or on the screen

483
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,830
and agree on a price
and a quantity.

484
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:40,955
GARY GENSLER: There you go.

485
00:22:40,955 --> 00:22:43,970
It's just you bid a price.

486
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:48,440
And somebody hits the
bid or lifts the offer.

487
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,480
Those are the terms when
you're on the phone.

488
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,070
I left your offer.

489
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,970
I hit your bid.

490
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:56,640
Or at least it
was when I did it.

491
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,420
Still?

492
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,360
Or no, maybe not.

493
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,590
What's that?

494
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:01,220
Still.

495
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,820
All right.

496
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,320
Question?

497
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,248
AUDIENCE: Just not
on the phone anymore.

498
00:23:05,248 --> 00:23:06,212
[LAUGHTER]

499
00:23:06,212 --> 00:23:07,250
GARY GENSLER: Ah, yeah.

500
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:08,560
That's it.

501
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,260
What's that?

502
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,640
AUDIENCE: You just hit a button.

503
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,450
GARY GENSLER: Just hit a button.

504
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,658
AUDIENCE: I worked on the
[INAUDIBLE] desk at Goldman

505
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:15,190
So we didn't talk to anyone.

506
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,175
GARY GENSLER: You
didn't talk to anybody?

507
00:23:17,175 --> 00:23:19,050
Can you go months without
talking to anybody?

508
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,570
AUDIENCE: No, we
talked a little.

509
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:20,990
GARY GENSLER: What's that?

510
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:21,942
AUDIENCE: We talked
a little bit.

511
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:22,700
[? But it was always ?]
[? kinda ?] weird.

512
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,050
GARY GENSLER: All right.

513
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:26,600
I guess I'm a dinosaur.

514
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,360
Yeah.

515
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:27,860
Yeah.

516
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:31,280
The screens that I used to
look at at Goldman Sachs,

517
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,120
it was green.

518
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

519
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,800
You know.

520
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,190
You know the screens.

521
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:40,250
Kelly is thinking, what
is he talking about?

522
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:40,750
Right?

523
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,610
Look it up on the internet.

524
00:23:44,610 --> 00:23:47,370
[? You're ?] [? fine. ?]
[? You're ?] [? fine. ?] There

525
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:50,280
wasn't any color
on those screens.

526
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,100
So execution is
basically I buy, you

527
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:58,070
sell, we agree upon a
price, a price and a volume.

528
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,620
That's really what execution is.

529
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:04,170
But when you execute, you still
need to do a few other things.

530
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:05,892
And it's called
clearing and settling.

531
00:24:05,892 --> 00:24:07,600
When I was on a trading
floor, I couldn't

532
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,142
have told you what
the difference was

533
00:24:09,142 --> 00:24:10,520
between clearing and settling.

534
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:14,070
That was something
somebody else did, frankly.

535
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:16,770
I'll admit it.

536
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:18,440
They were really
terrific professionals.

537
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,460
But they had their job.

538
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,110
I had a different job.

539
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:24,380
Clearing is performing
all of these functions.

540
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,810
Authenticating
somebody is there,

541
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:28,860
making sure you actually
have those securities,

542
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,680
and importantly this
thing called netting.

543
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,780
How about settlement?

544
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,620
Anybody want to say?

545
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,828
I know it's written up there.

546
00:24:34,828 --> 00:24:36,680
But anybody want
to just say what--

547
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:41,390
we've talked about ledgers
for seven or 10 weeks now.

548
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:43,730
What do you think a
settlement really means

549
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:47,190
in the context of a ledger?

550
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:49,290
Did I see a hand up here?

551
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:50,190
Yes, I did.

552
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,240
I did see a hand up.

553
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:51,990
What's settlement?

554
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,190
AUDIENCE: Running the
entries on the ledger.

555
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:54,497
What's in, what's out.

556
00:24:54,497 --> 00:24:55,330
GARY GENSLER: Right.

557
00:24:55,330 --> 00:25:00,000
It's making a final
recording on a ledger,

558
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,280
finally moving
something on a ledger.

559
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,480
You could be moving the
ownership of an asset

560
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,940
or the ownership of cash.

561
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,840
And when you do both
at the same time,

562
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,130
it's called delivery
versus payment, or DVP.

563
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:21,490
It's just a final change
of data record on a ledger.

564
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:22,630
In the old days--

565
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:25,010
I'm talking about
before I was doing it.

566
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:27,970
But 40 years to
hundreds of years

567
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:30,240
ago, it was
physically delivering

568
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,840
a physical piece of paper which
was a equity security or a bond

569
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,100
security.

570
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,850
But it all got dematerialized
starting in the 1970s.

571
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:41,950
And by the 1990s,
it was pretty much--

572
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:44,260
in this country and the UK--

573
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:48,400
it was pretty much
dematerialized securities,

574
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,960
that everything's digitized now
in the equity markets in nearly

575
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,290
every country that
you're all from and maybe

576
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:59,200
with some small exceptions.

577
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,240
So execution is I buy,
you sell, volume price.

578
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,760
We've legally agreed
to something verbally.

579
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:10,810
And billions of dollars
can trade on the phone

580
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:13,330
or in the computer.

581
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:14,650
Legally, it's executed.

582
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:17,620
Clearing is trying to make
sure that you actually

583
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:20,780
have the securities, and
I actually have the cash.

584
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,670
We do some netting.

585
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:23,320
We authenticate.

586
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,680
And settlement is actually
moving the data on the ledgers.

587
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,020
Three steps.

588
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,460
This is the benefit of netting.

589
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,750
It was just one chart that
I could find somewhere.

590
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,690
It's actually the
Australian Stock Exchange

591
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:37,540
had it on their website.

592
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:40,430
But if you have multi-parties
in the transaction,

593
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:42,400
which was on the
left hand side--

594
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,460
and these are just arrows of
all the different transactions

595
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:48,850
that could occur in
one little example--

596
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:56,310
and instead you interpose
a central intermediary,

597
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:58,840
you can do a lot of netting.

598
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,270
And look at participant
C. Participant C

599
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:05,890
only has an exposure of
selling 35 of whatever they're

600
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:10,930
selling, some stock, versus
all these other transactions.

601
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:14,610
And this is a very simple case.

602
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:20,940
But if you have 20 or a hundred
clearing members that are all

603
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:24,300
big brokerage houses and
they're doing thousands or even

604
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:28,550
hundreds of thousands
of trades a day,

605
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:32,690
you have an awful
lot of transactions.

606
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:35,750
And the gross transactions
versus the net

607
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,560
is quite a difference.

608
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:41,660
That netting can bring down
numbers 90 plus percent

609
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:45,410
or maybe even 99% or more.

610
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:47,780
So central intermediaries--

611
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:51,060
I know this goes against Satoshi
Nakamoto's whole concept--

612
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:57,370
but central intermediaries came
about in the securities market

613
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:58,580
for a bunch of reasons.

614
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:03,890
But one of the biggest
ones was netting.

615
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,140
Brotish?

616
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,990
And it's a really
important concept

617
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,640
in the back office
of Wall Street.

618
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,473
AUDIENCE: I'm not
familiar with the concept.

619
00:28:11,473 --> 00:28:12,370
So [INAUDIBLE].

620
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:13,540
GARY GENSLER: You're
saying you're familiar?

621
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,000
AUDIENCE: I'm not familiar
with this concept,

622
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,460
so a clarification question.

623
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,657
GARY GENSLER: Please.

624
00:28:17,657 --> 00:28:19,240
AUDIENCE: When we
do netting, it seems

625
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,250
that we are losing
a lot of information

626
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,630
here from the
gross transactions.

627
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:23,680
So is it--

628
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,100
GARY GENSLER: That's right.

629
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,990
AUDIENCE: --just the
transfer of the asset

630
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:27,940
is done through the
netting, but the records

631
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,040
of all the gross
transactions are still there

632
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,450
with the central intermediaries?

633
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:32,825
GARY GENSLER: Very
good question.

634
00:28:32,825 --> 00:28:35,230
So are we losing information?

635
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:41,110
Or are we just lessening the
lines of counterparty risk

636
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,400
in the transactions?

637
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,290
And the answer is,
if done properly,

638
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:48,880
you still keep the
information of all of these.

639
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,880
And in the real world, this
is just eight transactions.

640
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,910
It's netted down to four.

641
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:56,410
Right?

642
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:58,720
So this is eight transactions
netted down to four.

643
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,110
Usually this is millions
of transactions netted down

644
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:06,420
to tens of thousands or maybe
millions of transactions

645
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:11,010
literally netted down to, if
there was 100 clearing members,

646
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:13,200
it would be 100
transactions, because they'd

647
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:21,750
each have one net transaction
per security, per security.

648
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:24,000
And so you need to
keep the information

649
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,430
of the millions of
transactions to properly

650
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:29,880
record for your
customers, for your taxes,

651
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,210
for all sorts of other reasons.

652
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:36,270
But you've netted down
for counterparty reasons.

653
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:39,270
Does that help?

654
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,390
Question over here.

655
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:40,890
Sean.

656
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:43,145
AUDIENCE: I was just curious.

657
00:29:43,145 --> 00:29:45,220
It's very understandable
for equities.

658
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,796
But for principal
commodities, [? the full ?]

659
00:29:47,796 --> 00:29:52,060
commodity derivatives, for
instance in the clearing space,

660
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:54,540
does it actually involve
the physical delivery

661
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:59,700
of the netted
commodity [INAUDIBLE]??

662
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,242
Because there's a different type
for delivery, and how that--

663
00:30:02,242 --> 00:30:02,950
GARY GENSLER: OK.

664
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:04,590
So Sean's asked
the question, what

665
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,660
if you're not dealing
with digitized assets,

666
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,990
but physical assets?

667
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:08,490
I think.

668
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:09,780
You used the word commodity.

669
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,865
But I was presuming
you meant physical.

670
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,370
So some of the innovations
of the 19th century

671
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:19,740
relate here when
they started to have

672
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:22,770
standardized contracts
for commodities

673
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:26,610
that were held in warehouses.

674
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:31,550
In essence, to facilitate
some of this netting

675
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:34,730
was also why central
warehouses, this clearing

676
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:36,890
house in the middle in
physical commodities,

677
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:40,310
could be a warehouse that held
the gold, held the silver,

678
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:42,830
held the corn or wheat.

679
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:45,560
And if they're holding
that corn or wheat,

680
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,230
they started to have
specifications as to what

681
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:50,390
standards there were.

682
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,850
In gold and silver,
it was percent.

683
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:59,065
It was called the,
let's see, assay--

684
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:00,440
I'm trying to
remember the word--

685
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:04,100
but what percent
gold or silver it is.

686
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:07,070
But in corn and wheat,
there was a more detailed

687
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:12,680
what's going into the warehouse
to commoditize it so that it

688
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,990
was a standard contract.

689
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:20,230
If it's truly physical and not
commodity, it's much harder.

690
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:26,290
Then you can't really net down
my house versus Shimon's house.

691
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:28,905
They're two different houses.

692
00:31:28,905 --> 00:31:31,460
Does that help?

693
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,870
But literally by the
late 19th century,

694
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:37,200
even in the commodities
space running out of Chicago,

695
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,140
they figured out
central clearing houses

696
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:43,610
with a lot of counterparty risk.

697
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,560
So there's an economic
reason we have

698
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,970
centralized clearing houses.

699
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:51,980
And the biggest economic
reason is netting.

700
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:56,330
And netting lowers something
called counterparty risk.

701
00:31:56,330 --> 00:32:00,530
Instead of having literally
millions of transactions,

702
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:02,660
you'll have thousands.

703
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,398
And you'll have less
counterparty risk.

704
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:05,690
It also lowers one other thing.

705
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,130
So it lowers counterparty risk.

706
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:09,130
And what is the other
thing you think it lowers?

707
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:11,223
Anybody?

708
00:32:11,223 --> 00:32:12,390
AUDIENCE: Transactions cost.

709
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:14,682
GARY GENSLER: Transactions
cost because it's efficient.

710
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,850
We used to call it you take
a lot of lines off the page.

711
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:23,520
So in the old human
days, you'd have

712
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:28,390
to have fewer humans
actually pushing paper.

713
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:29,650
Hugo.

714
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:32,230
AUDIENCE: Another
clarification question.

715
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:35,650
So from the participants side,
so from a hedge fund side

716
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:39,615
or whatever or a
trading desk side,

717
00:32:39,615 --> 00:32:41,740
do they just go about their
day trading everything?

718
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:44,183
And then the next day
the clearing house

719
00:32:44,183 --> 00:32:46,600
tells them, OK, you made all
these transactions yesterday.

720
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,420
But we really only
need 35 [INAUDIBLE]..

721
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,790
Or how does it [INAUDIBLE]?

722
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:56,110
GARY GENSLER: In that
case, looking back to this,

723
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,760
you are either the
buyer or seller.

724
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,200
And you're dealing
with a broker.

725
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,713
So if you're a hedge
fund, you often

726
00:33:03,713 --> 00:33:05,380
enter into an arrangement
with a broker.

727
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,640
And it's called a prime
brokerage arrangement.

728
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,640
And you might have a prime
brokerage arrangement

729
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,680
with more than one
Wall Street firm.

730
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,580
But you rarely would have
it with more than three.

731
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:17,130
So even if I'm doing a
trade through Merrill Lynch,

732
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:18,900
if my prime brokerage
arrangement is

733
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:25,420
at Goldman Sachs, Merrill is
going to get a commission.

734
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,970
But they're going to give up
my prime brokerage arrangements

735
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:28,870
to Goldman Sachs.

736
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:32,950
And that helps me, me the hedge
fund, get more netting as well.

737
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:36,100
And that's a development
in the last 20 years,

738
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:39,670
this concept of prime brokerage.

739
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:41,260
But to answer your
question, yes.

740
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,370
I go about my business.

741
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:43,560
I trade all day.

742
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:48,130
And unless I get a phone call
or an electronic communication

743
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:51,870
from my prime brokerage
saying you've hit your lines,

744
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:56,880
you do have credit limits and
position limits in essence.

745
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,650
But your prime brokerage--

746
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:01,650
and I might say, well, I
need something moved over.

747
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:05,220
I need some more credit today.

748
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:05,862
But yes.

749
00:34:05,862 --> 00:34:08,070
You go about your business
until your prime brokerage

750
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:11,020
says slow down.

751
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:11,520
Shimon?

752
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,690
AUDIENCE: But [INAUDIBLE]
question says that

753
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:16,580
if you're a lot like LTCM--

754
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,372
GARY GENSLER: Long-Term
Capital Management.

755
00:34:18,372 --> 00:34:20,622
AUDIENCE: --at some point,
they were running a balance

756
00:34:20,622 --> 00:34:22,230
sheet of a trillion dollars.

757
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:24,409
And part of the reason
why, when bankrupt is they

758
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:27,145
didn't want to use
one prime broker,

759
00:34:27,145 --> 00:34:29,270
because they don't want to
reveal all their trades.

760
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:31,389
But then their prime
brokers could not

761
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:35,570
net out their positions, because
I may hold one leg with you

762
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:38,739
and another leg with you.

763
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:41,120
The net may be zero.

764
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,429
But there's no way for
you to actually reconcile

765
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:46,670
that or reconcile that risk.

766
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,610
So it's a real problem.

767
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:50,360
GARY GENSLER: Long-Term
Capital Management

768
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:55,250
was a hedge fund
operating in Connecticut.

769
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:57,590
It was founded in
the early 1990s

770
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:59,790
by a man named John
Meriwether, who

771
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:03,610
is a very famous trader
from Salomon Brothers

772
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:05,300
and very successful.

773
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:10,460
And then he started it with
some remarkable finance

774
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:14,060
faculty from here, at
MIT, and elsewhere--

775
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:17,000
Bob Merton, who is
a Nobel laureate.

776
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,220
Brilliant, brilliant
team of folks.

777
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,940
But they ran into a little
challenge four years later.

778
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:26,750
They had about $125 billion
balance sheet, $4 billion

779
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:30,800
in capital, and 1.2
trillion in swaps.

780
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,000
Why do I know the numbers?

781
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,880
I got the phone call with my
one-year-old sitting on my lap.

782
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,620
And I picked up the phone.

783
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,120
And I said, hello?

784
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:40,790
And the voice on the other
line said, Treasury operator.

785
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:42,830
I've got the Treasury
secretary for you.

786
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:43,820
And I get on the phone.

787
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:44,930
I go, yes, Bob?

788
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:45,960
It was Bob Rubin.

789
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,210
It was the Treasury secretary.

790
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:47,950
Bob, what's up?

791
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:48,850
It was a Saturday.

792
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:50,980
Isabel was on my lap.

793
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,590
He says, do you know anything
about Long-Term Capital

794
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,180
Management?

795
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:56,050
He goes through
some of the figures.

796
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:56,800
I'll never forget.

797
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,020
He says, I hear from Alan--

798
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:02,090
that would be Alan Greenspan,
who was the head of the Federal

799
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:02,620
Reserve--

800
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:05,005
I hear from Alan that they
have over a trillion dollars

801
00:36:05,005 --> 00:36:06,710
of derivatives.

802
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:08,470
That's Shimon's number.

803
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:10,357
He says, is that a big number?

804
00:36:10,357 --> 00:36:12,440
Well, you have to understand,
Bob's sense of humor

805
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:17,410
was quite-- at that moment,
he knew it was a big number.

806
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:19,990
So I flew up the next day.

807
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:22,630
And with somebody from
the Federal Reserve

808
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:25,660
Bank in New York,
Peter Fisher, we

809
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,880
sat around the
conference table looking

810
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,040
at these facts and figures.

811
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:33,850
And then I got back on the plane
and flew back to Washington

812
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:34,840
to be with my family.

813
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:37,510
The next day was actually Rosh
Hashanah, the Jewish holiday.

814
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:40,230
And I wasn't going to work.

815
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:43,910
And I had to call Bob and
his deputy, Larry Summers,

816
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,160
up and give them my feedback.

817
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,040
And I said, this
thing's going down.

818
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,100
Bear Stearns was
their prime brokerage.

819
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:55,010
And Bear Stearns, who 20
years later failed themselves,

820
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:58,730
but Bear Stearns said, we're
pulling the prime brokerage

821
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:01,460
account if you can't
post another half

822
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:04,015
a billion dollars by Wednesday.

823
00:37:04,015 --> 00:37:05,390
Well, there was
no way they could

824
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,010
post another half
a billion dollars,

825
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:08,840
because their $4
billion of capital

826
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,210
we could best figure on
that Sunday was somewhere

827
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:16,427
covering around 400 or 500
million at that point in time.

828
00:37:16,427 --> 00:37:18,010
Well, when you have
a lot of leverage,

829
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:20,860
you have $1.2 trillion of
derivatives which are all

830
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,690
sort of leveraged in
one way or another

831
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:25,660
and you've got $125
billion balance sheet, even

832
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,870
with the best minds, the
best finance faculty--

833
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:32,160
and they really are
terrific individuals.

834
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,440
And Meriwether was
quite a trader.

835
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,390
Sometimes markets
go against you.

836
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:42,210
Correlation risk, liquidity
risk, and so forth.

837
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:47,090
So they pulled the plug
the next day, basically.

838
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:49,850
That's the Long-Term Capital
Management story I remember.

839
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:54,140
But it's just because I
kind of had to live it.

840
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:57,620
But to answer your question,
you can trade all day

841
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:02,550
until your prime broker
says, Hugo, slow down,

842
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,980
because they're
extending credit to you--

843
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:08,250
the prime broker is--

844
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,510
intraday.

845
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:11,520
And one of the big risks,
one of the big risks

846
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,300
in the financial crisis--

847
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:16,710
and certainly Ben Bernanke,
who is chairing the US Federal

848
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:20,190
Reserve and others had to deal
with it in the middle of 2008--

849
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:23,800
is most commercial banks,
so they don't have a broker.

850
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,700
They're banks.

851
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,690
They're the brokers
themselves-- were extending

852
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:30,150
significant amount
of intraday credit

853
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:36,980
to each other that, in 2008,
wasn't terribly well measured

854
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:40,460
in the repo markets
and in other markets.

855
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:44,400
And that's changed subsequently.

856
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,250
But you wouldn't
have been a big bank.

857
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:49,130
You would have probably
been shut down.

858
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:50,360
Sorry.

859
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,160
Or maybe not.

860
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:57,020
So netting is the biggest
benefit of clearing.

861
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:00,770
But it's also efficiency
and taking down

862
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:04,320
a lot of operating
lines of code.

863
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,000
This is a chart.

864
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,420
I'm not going to spend
a lot of time on it.

865
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,550
But this is right off the
Australian Stock Exchange

866
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,050
website.

867
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,970
And I thought, well,
why not take that?

868
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:15,040
They have 2 million investors,
the market participants

869
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:18,160
or brokers in a much
smaller market than the US.

870
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:24,340
And Australia has 77 brokers,
registered, regulated brokers.

871
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:28,840
And then they have the clearing
house called CHESS, C-H-E-S-S,

872
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,090
which I can't quite remember
what it all stands for.

873
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:33,490
But SS is Settlement System.

874
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:35,170
Clearing house--

875
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:36,940
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

876
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,900
GARY GENSLER: What's that?

877
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:39,660
What's it?

878
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,942
AUDIENCE: Clearing House
Subregistered System.

879
00:39:41,942 --> 00:39:43,400
GARY GENSLER:
Subregistered System.

880
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,300
Thank you.

881
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,890
Is it Equity for E?

882
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:46,890
AUDIENCE: There is none.

883
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:48,600
GARY GENSLER: There is none.

884
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,910
But they have the Australian
Stock Exchange Clear

885
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:55,080
and Australia Stock
Exchange Settlement,

886
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:58,050
because they actually put it
in two different places, two

887
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:59,400
different things.

888
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,100
The clearinghouse is doing
what we talked about--

889
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:06,850
mostly netting, lowering
the lines of code,

890
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:08,320
and then settlement.

891
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:12,700
And basically, because we're
in a trade day plus two days,

892
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:16,440
on the first day is all the
clearing and the netting.

893
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,490
And you better show up
with your securities.

894
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:21,160
And on the second
day is settlement.

895
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,820
Electronics and technology
could make this simultaneous.

896
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,560
But most market
participants like

897
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:34,050
to have some ability to do
gross trading against net's

898
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:35,640
positions.

899
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:39,030
So there's a lot of
economics and market practice

900
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:43,510
and structure behind keeping
some delayed settlement.

901
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,260
And the markets have
grown up around that.

902
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:46,500
Ross.

903
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:50,555
AUDIENCE: If it's not delayed,
if it was instantaneous,

904
00:40:50,555 --> 00:40:52,430
wouldn't that get rid
of the benefits of net?

905
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:54,940
And you'd have to have every
trade go right through.

906
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:57,240
So it has to be that you
wait until the end of the day

907
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,948
or whatever period
[INTERPOSING VOICES]..

908
00:40:58,948 --> 00:41:01,860
GARY GENSLER: So Ross just
raised the number one reason,

909
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:08,070
economic reason, why
simultaneous clearing

910
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:13,650
and settling is not
that likely to happen.

911
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:15,660
The markets have
built themselves

912
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:20,400
around the benefits
of netting and also

913
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,390
stock loan, the ability to
borrow that security somewhere.

914
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:27,220
But you're absolutely right.

915
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:31,870
If there were simultaneous
execution and settlement, which

916
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:34,840
is what the Bitcoin network
in essence is supposed to be

917
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:38,973
and blockchain networks can
be, then you, in essence,

918
00:41:38,973 --> 00:41:39,640
have to prefund.

919
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:44,510
Every time Hugo
trades, he's going

920
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,630
to have to provide
his security to trade.

921
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:53,790
But then Tom would get
the security faster.

922
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:57,790
It would change the entire
prime brokerage model.

923
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:00,190
It doesn't mean markets,
Ross, couldn't adapt

924
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:02,860
and be structured that way.

925
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:05,230
But it would be fundamentally
a different structure.

926
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:08,280
Is this is a hand up?

927
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:11,670
AUDIENCE: So the [INAUDIBLE]
is really big with derivatives.

928
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,180
I don't see it.

929
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:14,290
I don't see what we use--

930
00:42:14,290 --> 00:42:17,400
I don't see it being a
primary issue with equities.

931
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,140
So if you were going to apply
this to equities, trading,

932
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:23,890
any cash instrument
basically, I don't

933
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:27,520
see the huge economic
value for netting.

934
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:32,230
GARY GENSLER: The huge economic
benefit for netting currently

935
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:36,095
is a lot of
operational efficiency.

936
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:36,720
AUDIENCE: Sure.

937
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,470
But if you're going to
place that with some--

938
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:40,180
GARY GENSLER: No.

939
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:45,520
And then also, because there
is two day counterparty risk,

940
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,880
you are lowering
that two day whatever

941
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:55,460
measure equity volatility, two
day equity volatility risk,

942
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,210
usually not collateralized.

943
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:05,120
AUDIENCE: I'm just
commenting on whether this--

944
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:12,240
you said the price that you pay
for replacing this system with

945
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,088
the blockchain based one would
be that you cannot net up.

946
00:43:16,088 --> 00:43:18,380
GARY GENSLER: I should have
said something in addition.

947
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:20,270
And the market
participants would have

948
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:23,090
to then prefund their trades.

949
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:26,120
I think the larger thing--

950
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:29,580
so if I speak in too much
financial technology,

951
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:33,930
let me say current markets
are you can sell or buy

952
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:39,910
a security without owning the
security or having the cash.

953
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:42,420
You can buy something
and not have the cash.

954
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:45,480
You have to deliver
the cash in two days.

955
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:47,700
And usually by that
evening or the next day,

956
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,580
you have to show
you have the cash.

957
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:53,520
You can sell a security
without owning the security.

958
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,320
And you only have to
really kind of deliver

959
00:43:55,320 --> 00:44:00,910
it, generally speaking,
the next day, on t plus 1.

960
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:04,690
If you went to a true
simultaneous clearing settling

961
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:07,270
and execution market,
you'd have to have

962
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:12,140
the cash and the security
before you execute.

963
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:14,380
And I think that's the
larger piece of it,

964
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:17,657
much larger than netting.

965
00:44:17,657 --> 00:44:18,990
AUDIENCE: I understand the cash.

966
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,580
But you need the
security, right?

967
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,620
Because if you're
going to buy it--

968
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:25,380
if you sell it and
you don't have it,

969
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:30,140
then you know it's going
to take two days to get one

970
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:32,262
to cover your first.

971
00:44:32,262 --> 00:44:34,720
GARY GENSLER: So through your
prime brokerage arrangement--

972
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,310
Hugo, remember, has a couple.

973
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:38,235
He's a big hedge fund.

974
00:44:38,235 --> 00:44:40,360
And he has what's called
a prime brokerage account.

975
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:43,570
Not at Bear Stearns
any longer, but maybe

976
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:44,750
it's at Goldman Sachs.

977
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:46,420
He's kind of fancy.

978
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:49,370
He's getting that.

979
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:51,220
Then his prime
brokerage account,

980
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:53,620
in his legal contractual
arrangements with them,

981
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:58,440
they will find that
security for him, maybe

982
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:00,060
from some other customer.

983
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:02,550
Maybe that security is
held in somebody else's

984
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:04,410
what's called a margin account.

985
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:08,520
And they will enter into
what's called a stock borrow.

986
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,640
But when he executes
on the phone,

987
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:14,670
he doesn't technically
already have that security.

988
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,540
He could be shorting it.

989
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:20,190
And his prime brokerage
account could then go find it

990
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:23,550
from the Goldman Sachs network.

991
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:25,820
AUDIENCE: But it's not
because you have plus two.

992
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:27,450
But it's because
you have a broker.

993
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:28,200
GARY GENSLER: Yes.

994
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:31,133
That's right, combined
with t plus 2.

995
00:45:31,133 --> 00:45:31,800
Let's take this.

996
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:33,060
And then I'm going to move on.

997
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:35,102
AUDIENCE: Can you just
take that one step further

998
00:45:35,102 --> 00:45:37,770
and explain why that's
beneficial broadly

999
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:39,950
versus just the system
we've grown accustomed to?

1000
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:41,700
GARY GENSLER: It's a
really good question.

1001
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,783
Is this just the system
we've grown accustomed to?

1002
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:45,120
Or is it beneficial?

1003
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,020
It's hard to tell.

1004
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:47,550
It is definitely
the system we've

1005
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:50,700
grown accustomed to over
a couple of centuries.

1006
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:55,870
And as we've gone from
transaction date plus five,

1007
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:58,500
which most markets
were I'm talking

1008
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,200
about 50 and 100
years ago, maybe it

1009
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,030
was even t plus
10 at some point.

1010
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:07,850
But t plus five to t plus
three to now t plus two,

1011
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:09,240
we've started to challenge that.

1012
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:12,090
But in the US, the
Depository Trust Corporation

1013
00:46:12,090 --> 00:46:14,460
provides same day settlement.

1014
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:20,300
And very few accounts ask
to do same day settlement.

1015
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:23,990
And I think it might be just
they've grown accustomed to it.

1016
00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:27,320
But I think there is some
benefit in this stock,

1017
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:30,710
loan stock borrow side.

1018
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:33,750
But I stand with
what I said earlier.

1019
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:37,100
I think the market could
work the other way.

1020
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:40,620
But it would be
a big adjustment.

1021
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:42,510
And there are some
benefits, because then

1022
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:45,780
Hugo, this hedge fund,
is being extended credit

1023
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:48,580
by his prime brokerage account.

1024
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:50,810
And the prime broker is
making some money on it.

1025
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:55,970
But also Hugo's taking
risk in that arrangement.

1026
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:59,960
Prefunding it would
be a different model.

1027
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:03,380
Some argue it would have less
liquidity in the marketplace.

1028
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:07,595
It would make shorting
stocks a little costlier.

1029
00:47:07,595 --> 00:47:08,720
I'm not sure they're right.

1030
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,700
But their argument
is that I'd have

1031
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:15,920
to borrow the securities
always, 100%, and halve it off

1032
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,760
before I sell, even if I'm
a multi-billion dollar hedge

1033
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,788
fund that has some
credit worthiness.

1034
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:25,810
Kelly.

1035
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:31,210
AUDIENCE: So the paper mentions
that their new system fails

1036
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:35,170
to basically recognize these
challenges, such as the fact

1037
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:37,000
that it'd be
advantaging the capital

1038
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,632
and operational efficiencies.

1039
00:47:38,632 --> 00:47:40,090
But it goes on to
say that it would

1040
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:43,080
be a step backwards for the
world's most liquid market.

1041
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:46,000
So what would necessarily
be implications

1042
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,620
for illiquid markets?

1043
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:50,530
Would it basically be that
people can make trades

1044
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:54,275
without having to interface
with extensions of credit?

1045
00:47:54,275 --> 00:47:56,650
GARY GENSLER: Are you talking
about illiquid markets that

1046
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:58,960
are centrally cleared
or illiquid markets that

1047
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,692
have no central clearing?

1048
00:48:00,692 --> 00:48:01,900
AUDIENCE: I guess maybe both.

1049
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:05,380
I'm just trying to understand
what the counter would

1050
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:09,130
be, that saying that there would
be advantages, efficiencies

1051
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:10,520
in liquid markets.

1052
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,750
But what with the opposite be?

1053
00:48:13,750 --> 00:48:17,930
Would there not be implications
for the [INAUDIBLE] markets?

1054
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:19,463
GARY GENSLER: So
Kelly's asking--

1055
00:48:19,463 --> 00:48:21,130
I don't remember the
comment, because it

1056
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:24,680
was in the Australian
Stock Exchange one.

1057
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:30,430
So in non-cleared
markets, things

1058
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:33,400
that are just so
illiquid-- my house.

1059
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,240
It's not cleared.

1060
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,400
It's not centrally cleared.

1061
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,400
Certain parts of the derivatives
markets aren't centrally clear.

1062
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,360
They're not, quote,
"liquid" enough.

1063
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:43,110
So I don't know.

1064
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:44,580
I don't know the comment.

1065
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:45,750
Maybe see me in class.

1066
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:49,080
And I'll look at the comment
and try to nail it for you.

1067
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,610
Is that all right?

1068
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:54,520
So I wanted to put this chart
up, because it was from 2011.

1069
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:57,070
I remembered it when
I was at the CFTC.

1070
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:59,290
But somebody at
the Fed of Chicago

1071
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:02,890
made this chart about
the US clearing systems.

1072
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:05,700
Yellow are all clearing houses.

1073
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,900
Red, the SEC, the Federal
Reserve, New York--

1074
00:49:11,162 --> 00:49:12,238
AUDIENCE: SBD?

1075
00:49:12,238 --> 00:49:13,030
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

1076
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:15,190
SEC, CFTC, and the
Federal Reserve.

1077
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:17,090
But they might have--

1078
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:17,590
New York.

1079
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:19,093
I don't even know
who New York SB--

1080
00:49:19,093 --> 00:49:21,010
AUDIENCE: New York State
Board of Derivatives.

1081
00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:23,420
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

1082
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:25,340
Somebody from the
Chicago Fed was

1083
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:28,760
trying to make the case that
our regulatory system in the US

1084
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:31,080
was a little bit complicated.

1085
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,350
And I think this was in
the midst of the debate

1086
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:35,000
about Dodd-Frank,
that they thought

1087
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,280
all oversight of
clearing houses should

1088
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,140
move to the Federal Reserve.

1089
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:40,940
But I remembered the
chart and found it.

1090
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:42,900
And I wanted to
share it with you.

1091
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,590
But the yellow are all
the clearing houses.

1092
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:47,870
There are a lot of
clearing houses in the US.

1093
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:49,410
There's one for bonds.

1094
00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:50,870
There's one for equities.

1095
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:52,970
There's multiple
ones for derivatives,

1096
00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:55,550
both from cash and
interest rate derivatives

1097
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:58,370
to energy derivatives to
credit default derivatives

1098
00:49:58,370 --> 00:49:59,480
and so forth.

1099
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:03,080
There's ones for options.

1100
00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:08,080
So I just wanted to lay it out.

1101
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:11,300
Finance is pretty complex.

1102
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:15,200
This is all
digitized, by the way.

1103
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,960
But in this
complexity, that's also

1104
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:20,570
where I think there's some
opportunity, whether it's

1105
00:50:20,570 --> 00:50:24,200
permissioned blockchain
and not fully permissioned

1106
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:28,190
list with tokens,
and inspired by--

1107
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:33,800
the green are exchanges.

1108
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,230
And I don't even think they
put a color up for brokers,

1109
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:36,730
did they?

1110
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:39,890
Because then you'd
have hundreds.

1111
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:44,330
There are multiple parties
sharing ledgers and reconciling

1112
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:45,170
their ledgers.

1113
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:47,210
Reconciliation means
I keep a ledger.

1114
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:48,510
Tom keeps a ledger.

1115
00:50:48,510 --> 00:50:50,480
It's both on our
database systems.

1116
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,245
And we keep testing and ensuring
that we have the same records.

1117
00:50:57,030 --> 00:51:00,120
This is a system that,
by its complexity

1118
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:05,960
and by its copies of
ledgers and reconciliation,

1119
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:10,100
has a lot of opportunity
for greater efficiency.

1120
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,620
And the question is whether
blockchain technology,

1121
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:17,260
maybe permissioned, can bring
some of that efficiency.

1122
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:18,480
That's the thought.

1123
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,272
And that's what the
chart was just trying--

1124
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,490
by the way, the Congress
didn't agree with the Fed.

1125
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:28,550
They left the authorities
at the SEC and CFTC.

1126
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:31,880
And those are for
stories other times.

1127
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,580
I personally felt it could
be a shared authority.

1128
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:36,650
And we ended up with
some shared authorities.

1129
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:41,010
But I thought that the CFTC
and SEC have domain knowledge.

1130
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:44,270
And it really important to keep
the SEC involved in securities

1131
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:48,260
clearing and the CFTC involved
in derivatives clearing

1132
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:52,970
for that domain knowledge, but
that the Federal Reserve also

1133
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:55,700
came in under something called
Title VIII of Dodd-Frank.

1134
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:57,440
And they also got authorities.

1135
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,320
So we made it more complicated,
because now there's

1136
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:04,430
multiple dotted lines for this.

1137
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:08,060
The Federal Reserve basically
has an account with everybody.

1138
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:12,410
Or they have some
oversight of everybody.

1139
00:52:12,410 --> 00:52:14,335
So then the question on
blockchain technology,

1140
00:52:14,335 --> 00:52:16,460
could you take the clearing
house out of the middle

1141
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:18,470
and do the thing on the right?

1142
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:22,500
And my question for you all is,
do you think the economics--

1143
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:24,570
I'm not talking
about the technology.

1144
00:52:24,570 --> 00:52:26,930
I'm not talking about
whether it's performance.

1145
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:29,540
If you wish, you can go five
or 10 years down the road

1146
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:32,660
and say it's got all this
scalability and performance.

1147
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:36,110
Do you think the technology,
without something

1148
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:40,250
in the middle, what's
the economics about that?

1149
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:42,200
Anybody?

1150
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:42,970
Eilon?

1151
00:52:42,970 --> 00:52:45,880
AUDIENCE: I still want
to support the left side

1152
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,645
for liquid markets
because of the netting.

1153
00:52:47,645 --> 00:52:49,020
GARY GENSLER:
Because of netting.

1154
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:49,603
AUDIENCE: Yes.

1155
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:54,180
I can't see a
blockchain solution

1156
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:56,850
working well when
you need netting

1157
00:52:56,850 --> 00:53:00,720
to enjoy the efficiencies
of selling and shorting,

1158
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:01,580
shorting basically.

1159
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:02,372
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

1160
00:53:02,372 --> 00:53:05,580
But the question really
is, can you somehow,

1161
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:10,090
on the right with
shared ledger, still

1162
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:12,410
get some benefit of netting?

1163
00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:12,910
Right?

1164
00:53:12,910 --> 00:53:14,950
You're saying you're
inclined here,

1165
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:19,820
because you want to get the
netting for economic reasons.

1166
00:53:19,820 --> 00:53:22,690
So as a ledger structure,
can you get the netting here?

1167
00:53:22,690 --> 00:53:24,620
Shimon?

1168
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:26,120
AUDIENCE: You don't
need the netting

1169
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:29,090
if it happens simultaneously.

1170
00:53:29,090 --> 00:53:32,273
Netting is it it is basically--

1171
00:53:32,273 --> 00:53:33,440
again, with cash instrument.

1172
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,857
I'm not talking
about derivatives.

1173
00:53:34,857 --> 00:53:36,710
Derivatives is a
different issue.

1174
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:38,330
With cash instruments,
the only reason

1175
00:53:38,330 --> 00:53:39,410
why you have
counterparty risk is

1176
00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:41,610
because it's not clear--
it was my understanding.

1177
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:43,640
Correct me-- is
because you don't

1178
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,890
have instantaneous settlement.

1179
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:47,480
If you have a
[INAUDIBLE] settlement,

1180
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:48,897
then you don't
care about netting.

1181
00:53:48,897 --> 00:53:51,550
AUDIENCE: You care because you
face so many transaction fees.

1182
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:52,092
AUDIENCE: No.

1183
00:53:52,092 --> 00:53:53,925
But that's going to be
a lot more efficient.

1184
00:53:53,925 --> 00:54:00,570
So why-- again, do you think the
[? real ?] transaction fees are

1185
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,300
a big economic issue here?

1186
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:02,910
AUDIENCE: Yes.

1187
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:03,930
That's what I think.

1188
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:06,040
GARY GENSLER: And I'm
sorry that you don't.

1189
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:07,220
AUDIENCE: So now it's fine.

1190
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:07,762
I don't know.

1191
00:54:07,762 --> 00:54:08,726
I mean, I don't know.

1192
00:54:08,726 --> 00:54:11,030
For really intense
help, how much

1193
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:15,050
do you pay per transaction with
the clearing house and without?

1194
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:18,950
Maybe the net will give you
only 10% of the transaction.

1195
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:21,230
But the cost of having
the clearing house

1196
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:22,903
is more than 10 times.

1197
00:54:22,903 --> 00:54:23,570
AUDIENCE: Maybe.

1198
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:25,760
AUDIENCE: So the economics
depends on those numbers,

1199
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,840
I think.

1200
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:30,570
GARY GENSLER: Is
that a question?

1201
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:31,140
Hugo?

1202
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:32,130
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1203
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:35,220
So you still can get
some of the netting.

1204
00:54:35,220 --> 00:54:38,250
Let's just talk about blockchain
transactions on Bitcoin.

1205
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:40,110
You can batch transactions.

1206
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,960
So you can have multiple
inputs and multiple outputs.

1207
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,590
And that's kind of like netting.

1208
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:46,682
Then you have to
have a second system

1209
00:54:46,682 --> 00:54:48,390
on top of that that
keeps track of what's

1210
00:54:48,390 --> 00:54:49,557
going on throughout the day.

1211
00:54:49,557 --> 00:54:52,430
And then it just
does the transactions

1212
00:54:52,430 --> 00:54:56,070
on a daily basis or an
hourly basis or whatever.

1213
00:54:56,070 --> 00:54:58,570
That takes care of that netting.

1214
00:54:58,570 --> 00:54:59,160
Right?

1215
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,660
GARY GENSLER: So
Hugo contends maybe

1216
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:03,150
you can get this economic
thing called netting

1217
00:55:03,150 --> 00:55:06,570
and still have a shared
distributed ledger.

1218
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:09,630
Or you could do it off chain.

1219
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:12,900
I think, Shimon
to your question,

1220
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:15,360
this is a big
economic thing either

1221
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:17,220
because we've just
grown accustomed to it

1222
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:21,360
over a couple centuries or
it's fundamental to how markets

1223
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:25,460
trade, that we don't prefund.

1224
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:29,770
It's that economics that
blockchain technology

1225
00:55:29,770 --> 00:55:31,690
will challenge.

1226
00:55:31,690 --> 00:55:34,060
But we might stay with
a central clearing house

1227
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:35,770
if the economics are that value.

1228
00:55:35,770 --> 00:55:40,900
Well, the economics of, in
essence, not prefunding,

1229
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:45,390
and thus, some
delayed settlement.

1230
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:48,210
Whereas in the past, we always
had delayed settlement at first

1231
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:50,100
because there was
so much paperwork.

1232
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:52,080
We had to have
delayed settlement.

1233
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:53,700
We went digitized.

1234
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:59,480
And now, really in 2018, we
don't need delayed settlement

1235
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:03,130
or batch processing.

1236
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:05,010
So now you've
exposed, well, wait.

1237
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:07,670
What are the economics?

1238
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:08,765
Tom and then Alin?

1239
00:56:08,765 --> 00:56:10,890
AUDIENCE: Could you still
have a delayed settlement

1240
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:14,290
with a blockchain system just
by using a smart contract?

1241
00:56:14,290 --> 00:56:15,290
GARY GENSLER: You could.

1242
00:56:15,290 --> 00:56:15,920
Absolutely.

1243
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:19,250
AUDIENCE: I mean, you
still keep this system

1244
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:23,210
that people are
accustomed to, but do it

1245
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:25,910
without the economic red
for the clearing house's

1246
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:27,080
sides or [INAUDIBLE].

1247
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:27,830
GARY GENSLER: Yes.

1248
00:56:27,830 --> 00:56:31,010
And it's what the
Australian Stock Exchange

1249
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:36,860
says they are using with the
digital asset company, Blythe

1250
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:39,620
Masters' company that's
their outside vendor using

1251
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:40,910
the HyperLedger Fabric.

1252
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:42,350
And they're using the code.

1253
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:47,585
They call a DAML, or Digital
Asset Machine Language?

1254
00:56:47,585 --> 00:56:48,710
I don't know what the M is.

1255
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:51,606
But they call it DAML.

1256
00:56:51,606 --> 00:56:52,797
Alin?

1257
00:56:52,797 --> 00:56:53,380
AUDIENCE: Yes.

1258
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:56,063
We've said you cannot
prefund on the right.

1259
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:56,730
Is that correct?

1260
00:57:01,927 --> 00:57:04,260
GARY GENSLER: I think you
could through smart contracts.

1261
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:05,790
I think you could find this.

1262
00:57:05,790 --> 00:57:10,860
But the challenge with just
the picture, the picture

1263
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:13,110
suggests there's no
central counterparty

1264
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:15,720
to do all the netting.

1265
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:19,290
And so the question is, can
you have this ledger structure

1266
00:57:19,290 --> 00:57:23,760
and still find a way to
net down all the positions?

1267
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,610
AUDIENCE: Well,
like Shimon said,

1268
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:28,140
there is no need for that.

1269
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:30,450
You get that implicitly
by recording everything

1270
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:31,672
and executing.

1271
00:57:31,672 --> 00:57:33,755
GARY GENSLER: But if you're
recording-- all right.

1272
00:57:33,755 --> 00:57:35,150
I'm agreeing with that, too.

1273
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:36,930
But that's where I
get to if you need

1274
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:42,360
to do Shimon's approach, which
is simultaneous execution

1275
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:45,180
and settlement, then
you need to prefund,

1276
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:47,550
even if that prefunding
is by nanoseconds.

1277
00:57:47,550 --> 00:57:49,377
But you need to prefund.

1278
00:57:49,377 --> 00:57:50,460
AUDIENCE: Not necessarily.

1279
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:52,430
You could, sort of
optimistically, you

1280
00:57:52,430 --> 00:57:55,895
could post a transaction that
says, I want to buy a stock.

1281
00:57:55,895 --> 00:57:57,270
And I'm not going
to prove to you

1282
00:57:57,270 --> 00:57:58,980
that I have money to buy it.

1283
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:01,900
You record it, if you were
saying optimistically.

1284
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:04,738
And later on--

1285
00:58:04,738 --> 00:58:05,780
GARY GENSLER: It depends.

1286
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:10,200
The word record-- let me use
a different word, settle.

1287
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:13,470
Settlement means final
legal rights have moved

1288
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:16,380
from one party to another.

1289
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:18,770
So the word settlement
has a meaning that I just

1290
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:20,060
want to come back to.

1291
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:22,730
It means I'm
recording on a ledger

1292
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:25,070
that I no longer
have legal rights.

1293
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:26,890
So this alpha has
legal rights to it.

1294
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:32,080
And I think you would have
to prefund if you were

1295
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,480
doing true settlement ledgers.

1296
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,100
AUDIENCE: Sure, sure.

1297
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:38,860
I guess I'm saying it seems like
you could simulate the clearing

1298
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:40,420
house.

1299
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:42,442
In the right side
of this picture,

1300
00:58:42,442 --> 00:58:43,900
the clearing house
just distributed

1301
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:45,070
using the consensus protocol.

1302
00:58:45,070 --> 00:58:45,940
GARY GENSLER: Right.

1303
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:48,593
I think you're right
that you could.

1304
00:58:48,593 --> 00:58:50,260
But if you're going
all the way to where

1305
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:54,590
Shimon is, like Bitcoin, and
you're doing final settlement,

1306
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:57,170
final settlement
recordation, then I

1307
00:58:57,170 --> 00:58:59,257
think you have to prefund.

1308
00:58:59,257 --> 00:59:00,590
A couple of questions over here.

1309
00:59:00,590 --> 00:59:02,700
Eric, Ross.

1310
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:06,470
AUDIENCE: The reason that the
prefunding was [INAUDIBLE]

1311
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:11,662
performed in the validation of
the block process, because--

1312
00:59:11,662 --> 00:59:12,620
GARY GENSLER: It could.

1313
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:15,110
I said it could even be
done during the nanoseconds.

1314
00:59:15,110 --> 00:59:18,380
But it has to be done before
you move the settlement.

1315
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:21,140
And that's what's
called clearing.

1316
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:24,080
So it's a question of whether
you have simultaneous execution

1317
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:28,130
and settlement, or you still
have execution, clearing,

1318
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:31,890
settlement, even if
separated by seconds,

1319
00:59:31,890 --> 00:59:35,250
but still literally
get granular.

1320
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:36,000
I apologize.

1321
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,380
This stuff is that granular.

1322
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:41,310
Back here.

1323
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:43,380
And then I'm going to move on.

1324
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:45,863
AUDIENCE: Why do you
consider prefunding--

1325
00:59:45,863 --> 00:59:46,530
maybe you don't.

1326
00:59:46,530 --> 00:59:49,315
But it seems simply
you consider prefunding

1327
00:59:49,315 --> 00:59:50,690
before you're
allowed to transact

1328
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:52,512
a negative economically.

1329
00:59:52,512 --> 00:59:54,220
GARY GENSLER: I
shouldn't sound that way.

1330
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:56,550
It's just that for
a couple years,

1331
00:59:56,550 --> 00:59:59,440
we've had delayed settlement.

1332
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:03,750
And so I'm saying if you are
a proponent of a system that

1333
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:08,390
has simultaneous
execution and settlement,

1334
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:09,810
you just have to deal with it.

1335
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:11,720
You're changing
the economic models

1336
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:15,720
that have been so common
in the capital markets.

1337
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:17,180
And when you take
that on, you just

1338
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:22,240
have to think through what are
the economics of that shift,

1339
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:25,280
from in essence a
delayed settlement,

1340
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:28,220
thus modest but
real counterparty

1341
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:32,120
risk that Hugo's got a prime
broker and he's got that,

1342
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:36,380
and moving to this new
model in capital markets.

1343
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:38,480
So I shouldn't come
across as negative.

1344
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:42,320
But I'm saying at least
it's a hurdle that you've

1345
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:45,320
got an adoption curve that's
going to be a challenge,

1346
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,710
I think, at a minimum.

1347
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:54,220
DTCC, when I first
spoke to them--

1348
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:58,480
and I've had a lively, ongoing
dialogue with the folks

1349
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:02,110
there on an occasional basis.

1350
01:01:02,110 --> 01:01:03,970
This was the biggest
issue they raised.

1351
01:01:03,970 --> 01:01:06,640
They said they looked
at blockchain technology

1352
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,950
starting several years ago.

1353
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:11,080
They talked to
their customer base.

1354
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:13,330
And they couldn't find that
their customer base really

1355
01:01:13,330 --> 01:01:16,990
wanted to go to simultaneous
execution and settlement.

1356
01:01:16,990 --> 01:01:18,430
They have same day settlement.

1357
01:01:18,430 --> 01:01:19,990
But it's end of day settlement.

1358
01:01:19,990 --> 01:01:23,253
So there's still several hours.

1359
01:01:23,253 --> 01:01:24,670
But they said, we
don't have a lot

1360
01:01:24,670 --> 01:01:28,390
of customers that really
want simultaneous execution

1361
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:29,680
and settlement.

1362
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:32,645
Now, that was commenting
on the demand side.

1363
01:01:32,645 --> 01:01:34,020
It's another
question whether you

1364
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:37,500
could adopt this lower cost,
do something, and change

1365
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:38,420
your capital market.

1366
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:46,380
So this is another look at it.

1367
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:49,080
This is also from the
Australian Stock Exchange,

1368
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,560
I think, website if I remember.

1369
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:52,080
But maybe it was
another website.

1370
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:54,870
The question is, could you
take out these middle parts?

1371
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:57,180
This is like
blockchain architecture

1372
01:01:57,180 --> 01:02:00,180
for clearing
central counterparty

1373
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:02,490
and the central
securities depository.

1374
01:02:02,490 --> 01:02:07,100
Because there's also somebody
who's got the central registry,

1375
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:09,270
and that central registry
are the two things.

1376
01:02:09,270 --> 01:02:11,640
Could you take this
out completely?

1377
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:15,510
That was the
question, in a sense.

1378
01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:19,320
So here are the projects that
are actually live or being

1379
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:19,830
explored.

1380
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:21,330
And we're going to
talk a little bit

1381
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:25,330
about Australian Stock
Exchange in the few minutes we

1382
01:02:25,330 --> 01:02:25,830
have left.

1383
01:02:25,830 --> 01:02:28,980
But this Australian
stock Exchange Project

1384
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:30,630
started in 2016.

1385
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:32,340
A bunch of requests
for proposals,

1386
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:34,420
like higher digital
asset holding,

1387
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:36,360
they're actually
actively working on it.

1388
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:38,770
It's a 25-year-old system.

1389
01:02:38,770 --> 01:02:40,200
And Jeff Sprecher said it, too.

1390
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,360
He said, you know, they
had a legacy system

1391
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:43,470
they needed to replace.

1392
01:02:43,470 --> 01:02:46,950
They decided to go with the
new technology of the day.

1393
01:02:46,950 --> 01:02:50,180
But Jeff wasn't
convinced they had to.

1394
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:53,240
But they feel that it
was the right thing

1395
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:58,250
to do, to go with that
new technology of the day.

1396
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:01,970
They believe-- and they've
put out reports as recently

1397
01:03:01,970 --> 01:03:03,830
as several weeks ago.

1398
01:03:03,830 --> 01:03:05,540
They believe they're
on the right path

1399
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:08,390
and that 15 or 20 years from
now, every clearing house

1400
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:10,070
will be using what
they would consider

1401
01:03:10,070 --> 01:03:12,320
a permissioned
blockchain solution,

1402
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:17,030
because it will so significantly
lower the back office

1403
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:20,000
costs for their
market participants

1404
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,010
who are now holding records.

1405
01:03:22,010 --> 01:03:27,620
Each bank, was it 77 members
from an earlier-- yeah.

1406
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:29,930
Each bank has to hold records.

1407
01:03:29,930 --> 01:03:32,750
It could be held
in a shared ledger.

1408
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:35,240
And they would lower
the reconciliation cost.

1409
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:36,980
And they believe
the second advantage

1410
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:38,630
is using smart contracts.

1411
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:41,570
Now, are they exactly
the smart contracts

1412
01:03:41,570 --> 01:03:43,170
like on the Ethereum network?

1413
01:03:43,170 --> 01:03:46,100
No, because they don't
have a native token.

1414
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:48,170
They don't have a DAP
and a native token.

1415
01:03:48,170 --> 01:03:51,410
But it's still automating
certain processes,

1416
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:56,510
automating certain I'll call
it back office processes.

1417
01:03:56,510 --> 01:03:58,130
So they're very committed to it.

1418
01:03:58,130 --> 01:04:00,950
And they're going to
roll it out in 2020.

1419
01:04:00,950 --> 01:04:05,210
And then, for 12 months,
run it simultaneous

1420
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:07,590
with their legacy system.

1421
01:04:07,590 --> 01:04:13,980
So their cut over for
assuring that it's resilient

1422
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:16,650
is at 12 month test.

1423
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:18,510
Most major market
infrastructures

1424
01:04:18,510 --> 01:04:21,850
that roll things out do not roll
simultaneously for 12 months.

1425
01:04:21,850 --> 01:04:24,210
But they all roll simultaneous.

1426
01:04:24,210 --> 01:04:28,380
Whether it's a month,
whether it's 90 days,

1427
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:31,200
you can't cut over the back
office of the New York Stock

1428
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:35,370
Exchange and just
test it for one day.

1429
01:04:35,370 --> 01:04:36,490
Or you can.

1430
01:04:36,490 --> 01:04:40,944
It's just kind of
choppy and a big risk.

1431
01:04:40,944 --> 01:04:42,090
AUDIENCE: Quick question.

1432
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:45,285
Are they going to use a stable
coin to settle the transaction?

1433
01:04:45,285 --> 01:04:47,160
How are they going to
settle the transaction?

1434
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:49,368
Because I can see how you
issue securities digitally.

1435
01:04:49,368 --> 01:04:50,740
But you cannot issue cash.

1436
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:51,870
GARY GENSLER: So
this is very good.

1437
01:04:51,870 --> 01:04:52,495
It's very good.

1438
01:04:52,495 --> 01:04:56,940
So all of these
clearing houses, they

1439
01:04:56,940 --> 01:05:00,840
are the final custodian
for the security.

1440
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:04,900
Securities are dematerialized,
meaning they're all digital.

1441
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:07,890
And so those digital
assets are held on a ledger

1442
01:05:07,890 --> 01:05:10,710
and what's called
the golden record.

1443
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:13,320
This is the words used in
the securities business.

1444
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:16,140
The gold record or the
golden record, meaning it

1445
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:19,083
is the legal,
verifiable thing you

1446
01:05:19,083 --> 01:05:20,250
can go to in a court of law.

1447
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:22,020
And it says, this
is who owns this.

1448
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:22,800
Alpha owns it.

1449
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:25,080
Not Hugo.

1450
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:26,790
Sorry.

1451
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:28,950
You're working with Goldman
Sachs, though, right?

1452
01:05:31,770 --> 01:05:34,830
That golden record is
there for securities.

1453
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:36,915
Who has the golden
record for cash?

1454
01:05:36,915 --> 01:05:38,040
AUDIENCE: The central bank?

1455
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:41,700
GARY GENSLER: The central
bank or the fractional banking

1456
01:05:41,700 --> 01:05:44,400
system, their commercial
bank subledger.

1457
01:05:47,370 --> 01:05:49,290
Clearing houses
around the globe would

1458
01:05:49,290 --> 01:05:54,280
like to be able to have direct
access to central bank money.

1459
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:58,100
And they currently do not in
any of the major jurisdictions

1460
01:05:58,100 --> 01:05:58,670
that I know.

1461
01:05:58,670 --> 01:05:59,950
I think.

1462
01:05:59,950 --> 01:06:04,790
So what Australia does now,
this is what they do now.

1463
01:06:04,790 --> 01:06:06,800
They net everybody down.

1464
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:08,120
They get to t plus two.

1465
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:09,380
They're on that second day.

1466
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:10,490
Everything's netted down.

1467
01:06:10,490 --> 01:06:14,350
And they're about to do
the whole closing out.

1468
01:06:14,350 --> 01:06:17,650
One second before they do
the security settlement,

1469
01:06:17,650 --> 01:06:20,300
they do the cash settlement.

1470
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:23,382
They call this Delivery
Versus Payment, DVP.

1471
01:06:23,382 --> 01:06:24,590
But they're a clearing house.

1472
01:06:24,590 --> 01:06:28,000
And they do not want to take
risk with the central bank.

1473
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,420
They take all the money
and settle all the cash

1474
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:35,170
with the Royal Bank of
Australia, RBA I guess.

1475
01:06:35,170 --> 01:06:36,280
Do I have the right name?

1476
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:40,300
Or is it a different-- is RBA
one of the banks in Australia?

1477
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:42,310
But they settle all the cash.

1478
01:06:42,310 --> 01:06:45,790
And just within a
second, they settle.

1479
01:06:45,790 --> 01:06:47,230
We think of it as DVP.

1480
01:06:47,230 --> 01:06:49,360
But it's actually
technically not.

1481
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:53,380
Inside their clearing
systems, they

1482
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:55,540
have a form of
Australian dollars

1483
01:06:55,540 --> 01:07:02,590
that is effectively digitally,
in their system, digital money.

1484
01:07:02,590 --> 01:07:04,090
In essence, what
they're doing is

1485
01:07:04,090 --> 01:07:11,497
clearing their internal digital
money versus Royal Bank money.

1486
01:07:11,497 --> 01:07:12,330
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

1487
01:07:12,330 --> 01:07:13,520
GARY GENSLER: All right.

1488
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:14,750
Sorry.

1489
01:07:14,750 --> 01:07:16,160
So these other projects--

1490
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:19,310
Estonia, the Tallinn
Stock Exchange,

1491
01:07:19,310 --> 01:07:21,690
is exploring proxy
voting and registration.

1492
01:07:21,690 --> 01:07:27,080
What's interesting-- who runs
the Estonian Stock Exchange?

1493
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:28,430
NASDAQ.

1494
01:07:28,430 --> 01:07:30,030
NASDAQ.

1495
01:07:30,030 --> 01:07:32,360
So NASDAQ runs it.

1496
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:33,710
And they're doing this project.

1497
01:07:33,710 --> 01:07:38,450
NASDAQ announced and went
live in 2015 on an illiquid.

1498
01:07:38,450 --> 01:07:41,650
So Kelly, you asked me
about illiquids earlier.

1499
01:07:41,650 --> 01:07:47,750
NASDAQ started a blockchain
technology platform in 2015

1500
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:51,140
on private securities,
which were not--

1501
01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:53,420
they certainly weren't liquid.

1502
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:55,790
I don't know enough about
what they did there as

1503
01:07:55,790 --> 01:07:58,370
to how illiquid they were.

1504
01:07:58,370 --> 01:08:03,380
But they felt, all right, this
is a place we could do this.

1505
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:06,175
And it's still gone live.

1506
01:08:06,175 --> 01:08:08,120
It's got very little use.

1507
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:09,565
But it's still there.

1508
01:08:09,565 --> 01:08:10,940
And they say
they're going to try

1509
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:14,720
to do it for mutual funds,
when you and I can just

1510
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:18,020
by interest in mutual funds.

1511
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:22,310
And NASDAQ's going to
offer that to mutual funds,

1512
01:08:22,310 --> 01:08:24,290
partly because
mutual funds aren't

1513
01:08:24,290 --> 01:08:28,399
in DTCC from what I understand.

1514
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:33,720
The others are just
really some tests.

1515
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:36,590
Japan Exchange Group for
the Tokyo Stock Exchange

1516
01:08:36,590 --> 01:08:37,850
has done some tests.

1517
01:08:37,850 --> 01:08:38,852
They've written papers.

1518
01:08:38,852 --> 01:08:40,310
They're sort of
interesting papers.

1519
01:08:40,310 --> 01:08:43,729
The last one was
earlier this year.

1520
01:08:43,729 --> 01:08:47,840
They're really trying it
just on post trade matching.

1521
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:50,810
One of the securities firms
in Japan, I can't remember,

1522
01:08:50,810 --> 01:08:54,620
is really pressing the Tokyo
Stock Exchange to do this.

1523
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:58,600
So there's some local commercial
politics that are going on.

1524
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:01,430
I can't remember
which exchange is--

1525
01:09:01,430 --> 01:09:02,149
not exchange.

1526
01:09:02,149 --> 01:09:06,740
One of the brokerage houses
is pushing them to do it.

1527
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:08,310
All permissioned systems.

1528
01:09:08,310 --> 01:09:12,960
No, to my knowledge,
permissionless systems.

1529
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:16,490
Let's talk about ISDA for
a few minutes, derivatives

1530
01:09:16,490 --> 01:09:20,750
common domain model.

1531
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:24,560
One of my former commissioner's
colleagues, Scott O'Malia,

1532
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:25,640
runs ISDA.

1533
01:09:29,689 --> 01:09:32,479
That's a international
trade organization.

1534
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:37,520
It's largely, largely
dominated by the 16 big banks

1535
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:43,100
around the globe that
probably transact 98% or 99%

1536
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:46,550
of derivatives around the globe.

1537
01:09:46,550 --> 01:09:50,359
And it was started in the
1980s to do all the forms,

1538
01:09:50,359 --> 01:09:54,140
all the forms to enter into the
legal contractual obligations

1539
01:09:54,140 --> 01:09:55,980
called swaps.

1540
01:09:55,980 --> 01:09:59,760
And over the years,
it's transitioned.

1541
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:01,500
It's also an advocacy group.

1542
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:04,470
And it lobbies
various regulators

1543
01:10:04,470 --> 01:10:06,840
in Europe and the US and Asia.

1544
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:08,970
But they've, a year or so
ago, said, wait a minute.

1545
01:10:08,970 --> 01:10:14,900
We could take a lot of the back
office of swaps, particularly

1546
01:10:14,900 --> 01:10:17,930
swaps that are not going
into clearing houses.

1547
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:20,840
So it's called the non-cleared
or uncleared swaps.

1548
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:24,320
And maybe we can
create smart contracts

1549
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:27,110
to automate a bunch
of contractual terms.

1550
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:28,860
So that's the
second bullet point.

1551
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:30,290
And they contracted out.

1552
01:10:30,290 --> 01:10:32,480
They put out a
request for proposal,

1553
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:34,700
basically, for
somebody to come up

1554
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:37,970
with machine readable
standard representation.

1555
01:10:37,970 --> 01:10:41,300
Call it code, a
scripting language.

1556
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:43,220
I can't remember if it's--

1557
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:45,200
oh, it's written in JavaScript.

1558
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:47,651
So written in Java
and JavaScript,

1559
01:10:47,651 --> 01:10:53,150
a standard machine readable
code of various events.

1560
01:10:53,150 --> 01:10:57,830
If it's a 20-year swap that's
going to pay every quarter 80

1561
01:10:57,830 --> 01:11:02,660
quarterly payments, each of
those quarterly payments,

1562
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:05,810
fixed versus floating
payments, is somehow

1563
01:11:05,810 --> 01:11:08,290
put into machine readable code.

1564
01:11:08,290 --> 01:11:11,570
And Scott and ISDA's
view was, if we

1565
01:11:11,570 --> 01:11:16,010
could get a broad consensus and
publish that machine readable

1566
01:11:16,010 --> 01:11:19,400
code that everybody agrees on,
maybe that machine readable

1567
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:23,390
code could take the
place of legal contracts.

1568
01:11:23,390 --> 01:11:27,150
ISDA, for 30 plus years, one
of their lines of business

1569
01:11:27,150 --> 01:11:30,590
is creating those
legal contracts.

1570
01:11:30,590 --> 01:11:32,990
Maybe we can get a
step ahead of this

1571
01:11:32,990 --> 01:11:38,170
and get consensus amongst
these 16 big banks.

1572
01:11:38,170 --> 01:11:41,240
There's about 100,000
users of swaps

1573
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:42,830
when you say all the customers.

1574
01:11:42,830 --> 01:11:45,870
It's not measured in
the tens of millions.

1575
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:47,990
I doubt anybody in
this room personally

1576
01:11:47,990 --> 01:11:50,870
has a 20-year or 10-year swap.

1577
01:11:50,870 --> 01:11:52,430
But I don't want to embarrass.

1578
01:11:52,430 --> 01:11:54,920
Maybe somebody does.

1579
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:59,440
But it's an institutional
product, largely.

1580
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:00,850
That's their product.

1581
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:03,880
And it covers new
transactions, rate resets,

1582
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:08,930
partial terminations,
as I listed up there.

1583
01:12:08,930 --> 01:12:10,510
Questions?

1584
01:12:10,510 --> 01:12:15,380
And it's definitely very
much inspired by Ethereum

1585
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:19,260
and smart contracts and DAPs.

1586
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:24,360
But in essence, it's not
really blockchain technology.

1587
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:26,370
It's inspired by it, in a sense.

1588
01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:30,060
AUDIENCE: They're just rewriting
the contracts instead of--

1589
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:33,410
they think they can have more
specificity and certainty

1590
01:12:33,410 --> 01:12:37,020
of about what the contract
means by writing it in contract.

1591
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:40,570
GARY GENSLER: And importantly,
importantly, efficiency--

1592
01:12:40,570 --> 01:12:44,530
to automate that which
humans are still doing, even

1593
01:12:44,530 --> 01:12:46,900
if it's in written contract.

1594
01:12:46,900 --> 01:12:49,130
So it's also automation
that's inspiring them.

1595
01:12:52,413 --> 01:12:53,580
But you're absolutely right.

1596
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:57,030
It's taking legal contract,
getting into machine readable

1597
01:12:57,030 --> 01:13:01,320
JavaScript code, getting
consensus on what that code is,

1598
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:04,008
getting some courts
to recognize it.

1599
01:13:04,008 --> 01:13:05,550
And then you won't
even need to write

1600
01:13:05,550 --> 01:13:09,510
some of this, a rate reset
or a partial termination,

1601
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:11,130
into the contract.

1602
01:13:11,130 --> 01:13:15,470
You'd be referencing this.

1603
01:13:15,470 --> 01:13:17,780
The longer term
objective is to say maybe

1604
01:13:17,780 --> 01:13:23,623
we can put even more
of it right into code.

1605
01:13:23,623 --> 01:13:26,040
AUDIENCE: People would have
to pool their money somewhere.

1606
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:27,290
It's like we were
talking about, right?

1607
01:13:27,290 --> 01:13:27,760
GARY GENSLER: That's correct.

1608
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:29,320
AUDIENCE: It's going
to execute itself,

1609
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:31,612
which is going to have to be
a pool of money somewhere.

1610
01:13:31,612 --> 01:13:34,580
GARY GENSLER: That you might
have to some prefund or self

1611
01:13:34,580 --> 01:13:36,410
fund or something.

1612
01:13:36,410 --> 01:13:38,650
Let me go back
here, and then up.

1613
01:13:38,650 --> 01:13:42,450
AUDIENCE: If they're using
blockchain on it, it can't be--

1614
01:13:42,450 --> 01:13:44,450
GARY GENSLER: They call
it a blockchain project.

1615
01:13:44,450 --> 01:13:46,620
But it's a--

1616
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:49,430
I think I've tried to
capture the essence of what

1617
01:13:49,430 --> 01:13:50,580
I think they have here.

1618
01:13:50,580 --> 01:13:52,250
It's definitely
blockchain inspired.

1619
01:13:52,250 --> 01:13:54,520
I'm just not sure it's really
stored on a blockchain.

1620
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:55,145
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1621
01:13:55,145 --> 01:13:58,030
Because if you look at
credit default swap,

1622
01:13:58,030 --> 01:14:00,515
you have to reference a credit
rating somewhere digitally.

1623
01:14:00,515 --> 01:14:03,470
And wherever that's referenced
digitally, if someone makes

1624
01:14:03,470 --> 01:14:05,990
a mistake, does a
transaction period that's

1625
01:14:05,990 --> 01:14:07,945
based on that mistake
and it's fixed,

1626
01:14:07,945 --> 01:14:09,820
someone's going to have
to be able to reverse

1627
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:11,245
that transaction.

1628
01:14:11,245 --> 01:14:12,620
GARY GENSLER: So
what's raised is

1629
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:16,760
what about if it's referencing
some oracle, referencing

1630
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:19,640
some price source,
and there's an error.

1631
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:21,440
I believe, as I
understand it, they're

1632
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:24,300
writing some of that
into the code as well.

1633
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:26,630
So if it's referencing a
price off the New York Stock

1634
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:30,080
Exchange, how it does
that, what open API

1635
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:34,190
it references, how it pulls it.

1636
01:14:34,190 --> 01:14:38,240
And they're trying
to say, let's make

1637
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:40,253
sure that it's what's
really verifiable.

1638
01:14:40,253 --> 01:14:42,170
There's one more slide
on this that will help.

1639
01:14:42,170 --> 01:14:43,220
This is their steps.

1640
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:47,000
This is their publicly
disclosed five steps.

1641
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,560
This was in an October paper.

1642
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,930
It wasn't part of your reading.

1643
01:14:50,930 --> 01:14:53,330
But select the parts of
derivatives contracts first.

1644
01:14:53,330 --> 01:14:54,622
Automation would be worthwhile.

1645
01:14:54,622 --> 01:14:55,372
They're effective.

1646
01:14:55,372 --> 01:14:56,000
It's efficient.

1647
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,170
Let's find something
we can automate.

1648
01:14:58,170 --> 01:15:00,980
Ross, that's their key driver.

1649
01:15:00,980 --> 01:15:06,680
Then try to express it the legal
terms in a more formalized way.

1650
01:15:06,680 --> 01:15:09,870
Get some standardization
about the law.

1651
01:15:09,870 --> 01:15:12,370
Get that be represented
as functions,

1652
01:15:12,370 --> 01:15:14,860
meaning computer code.

1653
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:16,620
So where can we be
efficient and automate?

1654
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:18,300
Where can we take
the legal words

1655
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:21,240
and get agreement,
put it into code,

1656
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:23,130
combine that into templates?

1657
01:15:23,130 --> 01:15:26,430
I think some of this
is referencing oracles.

1658
01:15:26,430 --> 01:15:29,100
And then validate that
the templates actually

1659
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:32,400
work and, ultimately, even
get some courts of law

1660
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:33,960
to accept them.

1661
01:15:33,960 --> 01:15:35,670
That's their game plan.

1662
01:15:40,829 --> 01:15:41,407
Shimon?

1663
01:15:41,407 --> 01:15:43,490
AUDIENCE: I was thinking
that there is potentially

1664
01:15:43,490 --> 01:15:45,800
huge implications beyond
efficiency, right?

1665
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:50,590
Because if you're at
Treasury or Goldman Sachs

1666
01:15:50,590 --> 01:15:55,950
signs a contract with
someone at Orange County,

1667
01:15:55,950 --> 01:15:57,690
their ability to
assess what is actually

1668
01:15:57,690 --> 01:16:03,840
written in the 30-page contract
was minimal or will be minimal.

1669
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:08,430
But it's a lot easier to do
risk management or assessment

1670
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:12,660
if you could just
use it as an API.

1671
01:16:12,660 --> 01:16:14,730
And you have an
outside company's

1672
01:16:14,730 --> 01:16:16,700
basically providing you
with the risk analysis.

1673
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:17,627
Right?

1674
01:16:17,627 --> 01:16:18,960
GARY GENSLER: I agree with that.

1675
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:21,190
We're still very much
at the early days.

1676
01:16:21,190 --> 01:16:24,210
But I think this is an
interesting, real, live thing.

1677
01:16:24,210 --> 01:16:27,100
There's a lot of
money behind this.

1678
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:30,260
The markets are hundreds
of trillions of dollars.

1679
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:33,540
If my former colleague
and ISDA pulls this off,

1680
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:36,000
they'll probably drive
some efficiency automation.

1681
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,820
They might lower some
counterparty risk and event

1682
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:41,880
risk or crisis risk.

1683
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:44,640
I think you could embed
these into true blockchain

1684
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:45,540
technology.

1685
01:16:45,540 --> 01:16:48,750
But I'm not sure it's
dependent upon it.

1686
01:16:48,750 --> 01:16:51,840
The automation of
a smart contract.

1687
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:54,330
Next Tuesday, next
Tuesday there's

1688
01:16:54,330 --> 01:16:55,560
a couple extra readings.

1689
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:56,870
We swapped out some readings.

1690
01:16:56,870 --> 01:16:58,140
It's trade finance.

1691
01:16:58,140 --> 01:16:58,980
Thank you.

1692
01:16:58,980 --> 01:17:02,330
[APPLAUSE]
