8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,720
GARY GENSLER:
Welcome, hello again.

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,070
Yeah, Yeah.

10
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,490
I put my jacket back on.

11
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:35,690
I figured I was doing public
policy today, had to look

12
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,340
a little official.

13
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:40,130
So let's talk a little
bit about public policy

14
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:43,280
and some of the challenges
that we're going to do.

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,890
And the overview of today--

16
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:48,380
we're going to chat a little bit
about the readings, of course.

17
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:53,360
And then I want to set it up
a bit on crypto finance, just

18
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,800
a simple term of this $200
or $250 billion dollar space,

19
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,140
because a lot of the public
policy is about crypto finance,

20
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,000
though there are some public
policy about underlying

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,060
blockchain technology.

22
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:11,090
It's both, but most of it's
about the financial markets

23
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:15,900
around cryptocurrencies
and crypto tokens.

24
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,310
Give an overall public
policy framework,

25
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,130
talk about the three
guardrails, the big rails

26
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:28,000
of illicit activity, financial
stability, and the public.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,800
And then I'm going
to share a little bit

28
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,100
of some slides and some thoughts
on public policy development.

29
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,590
As many of you know,
I've spent the last 20

30
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,860
years kicking around
politics and public policy.

31
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:44,260
And as two or three of you know,
in this spring, Simon Johnson

32
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,870
and I stood up a course
called Public Policy

33
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:47,950
and the Private Sector.

34
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,620
So it's maybe my little
advertisement for next spring,

35
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:55,640
because we're going to
stand it up again as well.

36
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:02,820
So the study questions which was
basically around public policy,

37
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,550
as you remember these questions.

38
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:11,050
And I'm sorry, because Talita
didn't give me my friendly list

39
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:14,540
as to who hasn't spoken up yet.

40
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,560
So that's Talita.

41
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,450
So you're saved, you're
saved, because now I can't

42
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:20,340
remember anybody that's not--

43
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,090
AUDIENCE: I can send
it to a printer.

44
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,016
GARY GENSLER: What's that?

45
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:22,910
AUDIENCE: I can send
it to a printer.

46
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,035
GARY GENSLER: Yeah, you
can send it to a printer.

47
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,380
It's hard to remember with
85 registered students

48
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,550
as to who hasn't spoken
and who has spoken.

49
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,820
But you're all
going, here now, he's

50
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,920
going to do cold calling now.

51
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,550
But the main study questions
that we're going through

52
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,790
are basically around the
public policy framework

53
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,090
and how it relates to
blockchain technology.

54
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,585
But Catalina, what did you
take from the readings?

55
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:59,830
AUDIENCE: What I took
from the readings

56
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,840
is that for blockchain
to further develop,

57
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,510
it has to be embedded
in the regulatory system

58
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:10,635
and in the policy system.

59
00:03:10,635 --> 00:03:14,430
In that way, for example,
investors will be better off.

60
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,010
They will have
protections, they will

61
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:21,420
feel better because they will
have some degree of certainty

62
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,595
that someone is
taking care of them.

63
00:03:24,595 --> 00:03:26,220
GARY GENSLER: And so
Catalina is saying

64
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,150
she took from the readings
that for further adoption,

65
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:32,680
investor protection, and the
confidence in the markets

66
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,970
are important.

67
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:37,673
Lauren, did I see that you're--

68
00:03:37,673 --> 00:03:38,590
AUDIENCE: Sorry, yeah.

69
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,297
So I was going to say--

70
00:03:40,297 --> 00:03:42,130
I mean, one of the
readings was a little bit

71
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,150
the opposite of this.

72
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:47,680
But to build on that, the
mention of regulations

73
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,440
and validating
blockchain a little bit

74
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,295
will help the players that
are already in the markets

75
00:03:53,295 --> 00:03:55,420
explore in that space, just
because they tend to be

76
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,100
a little more risk averse.

77
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,650
So they haven't really
dabbled in startups and things

78
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,695
that have the advantage.

79
00:04:00,695 --> 00:04:02,570
GARY GENSLER: So in
essence, that some people

80
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:06,310
were risk averse, the incumbents
are a bit risk averse.

81
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:11,860
And why would incumbent,
big-- oh, this is my fun list.

82
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,970
It's not your fun list.

83
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:17,230
But really, there's still
35 of you that have not even

84
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:20,529
spoken up in this class.

85
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:21,519
Don't be so shy.

86
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,350
Watch this.

87
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,220
Watch this.

88
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,220
Ariel Brito.

89
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,370
Not even here.

90
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:37,660
Even better, even better.

91
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,165
Talita, we have a sign up
sheet, too, that's going around?

92
00:04:40,165 --> 00:04:40,790
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

93
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,110
GARY GENSLER: All
right, that's fun.

94
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:50,440
Watch, I'll just say David, and
then see which David speaks up.

95
00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,370
This is going to be
a really interesting.

96
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,620
So you mean there's
no David Martin here.

97
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,930
Right here.

98
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,140
Oh.

99
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:10,930
AUDIENCE: So to
your first question,

100
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:14,050
this relates to the current
public policy frameworks

101
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:17,660
in my mind in two ways.

102
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:23,020
One, this technology
sits, in some ways,

103
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:25,810
in gaps in the current
regulatory framework.

104
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:29,960
It's not clear, for
example, that the CFTC--

105
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,050
because this could
be a commodity--

106
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:36,970
has as broad regulatory
authority as the SEC

107
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,570
does, for example, with respect
to the securities markets.

108
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,760
It's in a gap.

109
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:48,510
But the second thing is, even
if those gaps were closed,

110
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,450
for certain kinds of
blockchain technology,

111
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:54,100
the anonymity and secrecy of
it just prevents regulation

112
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,630
almost entirely.

113
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,630
So there's two things.

114
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:00,130
There's a gap question, and then
there's the impact of secrecy

115
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,310
and whether regulation
can find it.

116
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,310
GARY GENSLER: All right.

117
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:07,050
So there's a gap because
of the technology.

118
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:12,530
But are there other gaps also--

119
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:14,643
and your first name is?

120
00:06:14,643 --> 00:06:15,310
AUDIENCE: James.

121
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,670
GARY GENSLER: Jim.

122
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,421
AUDIENCE: James, yeah.

123
00:06:18,421 --> 00:06:24,000
So I think that another problem
with regulating blockchain

124
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,320
technology in general is because
the lack of intermediaries.

125
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,880
The way that traditional
regulation works

126
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,190
is that they try to have more
close access to intermediaries,

127
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,410
so that they can control
the intermediaries.

128
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:40,410
But now, there's
no intermediary.

129
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:43,007
So it's very hard
for you to control.

130
00:06:43,007 --> 00:06:44,590
GARY GENSLER: So
what James is raising

131
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:48,610
is there might be a whole change
in this ecosystem, a little bit

132
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,150
of the business model that
there's fewer intermediaries.

133
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,130
And a lot of
regulation, whether that

134
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:57,850
be tax, or investor
protection, or even

135
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:01,120
around illicit activity,
centers around intermediaries.

136
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,390
Why do you think it is
that so much of the law

137
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:07,260
centers around intermediaries?

138
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,980
It wasn't specific
in the readings.

139
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:12,130
But just why do you
think that that--

140
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:12,700
Isabella?

141
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,770
AUDIENCE: Well, I would
assume that if intermediaries

142
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:16,687
are going to be eliminated
by this technology,

143
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:18,580
then a lot of those
players would not really

144
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,900
want this technology
to be pushed forward.

145
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,407
So that's--

146
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:22,990
GARY GENSLER: All
right, so Isabella's

147
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,230
raising a point that
maybe intermediaries would

148
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:29,200
be threatened about
this technology.

149
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,170
But I'm also asking, why do you
think the law historically--

150
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:35,500
Adian?

151
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:41,020
Why the law has attached
requirements on intermediaries.

152
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,520
AUDIENCE: I think
it's just easier

153
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,960
to manage a group of
intermediaries that

154
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,940
are regulated by law,
so you can actually

155
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,440
look at the
transactions that happen

156
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,360
at the intermediary level.

157
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,100
GARY GENSLER: So
Adian's saying--

158
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,670
and in the red
jersey in the back,

159
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,020
I can't remember your name.

160
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,910
Dan.

161
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:01,900
AUDIENCE: So I just think that
if any of these intermediaries

162
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,360
experience something
that caused them to fail,

163
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,130
then you're bringing
down a lot more

164
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:08,200
than just that institution.

165
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,680
GARY GENSLER: So two ideas.

166
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,220
One is this
attachment point that

167
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:16,030
has some leverage
to it in the system.

168
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,000
You can exert some
public policy influence.

169
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,130
And one is that there
might be a point of failure

170
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:23,800
and you need to protect
the system from failure.

171
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,010
Other reasons back here?

172
00:08:26,908 --> 00:08:28,450
AUDIENCE: The
government just doesn't

173
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:31,630
have the manpower or the
resources to look at everyone.

174
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,400
And these
intermediaries actually

175
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,830
make money by
collecting this data.

176
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,700
And so the government
can just use that.

177
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,070
GARY GENSLER: So Jake's
raising a variation

178
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,570
of the force multiplying.

179
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:46,870
It's not only a node to apply,
but they have the resources.

180
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,870
So you're tapping into
JP Morgan's back office,

181
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,620
so to speak.

182
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,510
And back here, I'll take.

183
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,828
Sorry, your first name?

184
00:08:54,828 --> 00:08:55,704
AUDIENCE: Adam.

185
00:08:55,704 --> 00:08:56,142
GARY GENSLER: Adam.

186
00:08:56,142 --> 00:08:57,892
AUDIENCE: So the
intermediaries are also--

187
00:08:57,892 --> 00:09:02,740
they're a mechanism for trust to
allow trading between parties.

188
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:06,130
So the regulation then would
be placed in like a consumer

189
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:11,290
protection role to ensure
that those intermediaries are

190
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,790
someone to trust.

191
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,860
GARY GENSLER: So it's for
a collection of reasons

192
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,670
that public policy
officials around the globe

193
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:22,180
often attach requirements
to intermediaries,

194
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:25,090
because it's a node to get
it done, it's a resource,

195
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:28,000
they have deep
pockets sometimes.

196
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,590
Sometimes, it's because
they might fail.

197
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,170
And one thing that
wasn't mentioned

198
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,990
is sometimes
actually institutions

199
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:38,740
want to be regulated over time,
because it creates barriers

200
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,160
to entry.

201
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,300
It's usually not
in an early stage.

202
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:47,660
But later on, it's actually
the incumbents that often--

203
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,570
it creates some
barriers to entry

204
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:51,430
and they collect
some economic rents.

205
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,290
Hugo?

206
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:56,880
AUDIENCE: You can see that
starting now with the OG's

207
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,780
in the crypto space, like
Coinbase or like the Bittrex,

208
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:03,550
like the American
institutions that started

209
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:05,380
their exchange early on.

210
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,120
And now, they're
working with regulators

211
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,550
to see how they can
capture the market

212
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:12,120
to be the easy place to go.

213
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,120
GARY GENSLER: So what
were the letters you said?

214
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:14,845
OD?

215
00:10:14,845 --> 00:10:15,710
AUDIENCE: OG.

216
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:16,580
GARY GENSLER: OG.

217
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,665
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

218
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:23,060
GARY GENSLER: Does OG
stand for something?

219
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,837
AUDIENCE: Original gangster.

220
00:10:24,837 --> 00:10:26,170
GARY GENSLER: Original gangster.

221
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:28,060
Thank you, thank you.

222
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,540
My daughters will be
glad I know this now.

223
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,440
That's very good.

224
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,400
So it's moving from
the disruptor phase

225
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,260
to the near-incumbent phase.

226
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:43,210
And where is a firm Hugo's
raised like Coinbase or others?

227
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:46,120
Are they now the
incumbent in this only six

228
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,870
or 10-year-old
field, in essence?

229
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,530
We're going to talk a
lot about tax and bank

230
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,210
secrecy and the Howey Test.

231
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:58,090
And I'm going to save you from
the cold calls on the Howey

232
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:01,480
Test yet, but be prepared
when we get to that slide.

233
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,210
We'll talk a little bit more.

234
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:06,910
And then, of course, my
favorite, the Duck Test.

235
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:11,700
So anybody know who
the American poet--

236
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,850
AUDIENCE: W. Riley?

237
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,100
GARY GENSLER: Oh, really good.

238
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:15,820
Where's he from?

239
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:19,460
Didn't say?

240
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,420
Anybody where Riley's from?

241
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,400
No, it's not in--

242
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,720
I don't think it's in the--
is it in the testimony?

243
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,630
AUDIENCE: Indiana.

244
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,020
GARY GENSLER: Indiana, good.

245
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,940
You're right.

246
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:32,090
Seems like a good
Midwestern saying, you know?

247
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:35,630
AUDIENCE: If it walks like
a duck, talks like a duck,

248
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:38,420
and quacks like a
duck, it's a damn duck.

249
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,830
GARY GENSLER: There
you go, there you go.

250
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,330
No, no--

251
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:48,250
AUDIENCE: What if it's a
robotic duck or a computer

252
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:52,430
screen walking and
talking like a duck?

253
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,830
GARY GENSLER: So Christopher's
raising the question,

254
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:58,400
if it's a robotic duck,
a robotic duck that's

255
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,770
walking like a duck,
quacking like a duck,

256
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:05,110
and waddling like a
duck, is it a darn duck?

257
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:09,190
For purposes of public
policy, maybe it is, right?

258
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:12,970
If it's a smart contract
that's waddling like a duck

259
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:16,180
and quacking like a
duck, maybe it still

260
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,720
has the influence over
society like a duck.

261
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,130
And this Duck Test--

262
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:24,640
I didn't originated it,
Riley did 100 plus years ago.

263
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,850
But it is something that
regulators and public policy

264
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,290
people actually talk about.

265
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,230
It's one of those things,
if you're in Washington.

266
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:37,000
Well, other people might call it
different things, but the Duck

267
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:37,960
Test.

268
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:44,050
It's use common sense, and
then answer the question.

269
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:46,990
Oh my gosh, I assigned one of
my own writings as a reading.

270
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,550
So we'll skip over that.

271
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:51,305
So crypto, the world
of crypto finance,

272
00:12:51,305 --> 00:12:52,930
you've seen this
slide before, but it's

273
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:58,630
been quite volatile, about $220
billion in the last few days.

274
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:02,650
And a little over
50%, 54% is Bitcoin

275
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:06,340
and the other big
currencies right now

276
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:11,050
on market value, Ethereum,
Ripple, and the like.

277
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:13,900
We'll talk a lot about
initial coin offerings.

278
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,000
And are they securities
or are they not?

279
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,270
But I would note, in
terms of market value,

280
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:22,910
probably three
quarters of this space

281
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:25,760
has already been determined
by the Securities and Exchange

282
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,530
Commission not to be a security.

283
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:33,990
Bitcoin's 54%, Ether's about 15
points or something like that.

284
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,740
So you're all of a sudden
up to about 70 points,

285
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,080
and then there's a bunch of
other things that add up.

286
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,560
So about three quarters
of the market value

287
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:49,960
right now is what one might
call a cash, or a commodity,

288
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,750
but not a security
in this world.

289
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,400
And that's just relevant for
some of the debates that go on.

290
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,980
We talked about
this a little bit.

291
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:04,130
Like the lioness the
corner, incumbents

292
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:06,110
are starting to
eye crypto finance.

293
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:10,220
So it's raising some
of the challenges.

294
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,690
Why are they interested in this?

295
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:20,830
Why are incumbents interested
in getting into this place?

296
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:21,330
EG Wang?

297
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:26,530
Oh, come on.

298
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:27,910
I can't be this bad off.

299
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:31,140
Am I?

300
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,680
Really, all these people
haven't even said a word, huh.

301
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,800
Is EG here.

302
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,990
No, so look at this.

303
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:42,920
This is even easier.

304
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:47,770
Now, I'll find out if somebody's
signing in for other people.

305
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,955
How about Nikita?

306
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:51,555
AUDIENCE: Yes?

307
00:14:51,555 --> 00:14:53,930
GARY GENSLER: Why do you think
incumbents want to get in?

308
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:01,580
AUDIENCE: It's a
risky transaction.

309
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:05,240
From the viewpoint
[INAUDIBLE] it's

310
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,730
difficult to do
this crypto finance.

311
00:15:13,085 --> 00:15:14,952
GARY GENSLER: You said
it's difficult to do?

312
00:15:14,952 --> 00:15:16,010
AUDIENCE: For incumbents.

313
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:16,790
GARY GENSLER: Yeah,
but why did they

314
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,360
want to get into this space?

315
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,310
Why do they want to
be in crypto finance?

316
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,310
AUDIENCE: Part of it is
that it's highly volatile.

317
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:28,065
And how do you make money
largely off of volatility?

318
00:15:28,065 --> 00:15:29,690
And then there's also
a lot of people--

319
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:32,210
I think it's what, like 20
million Coinbase accounts.

320
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,390
GARY GENSLER: Right, right.

321
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,098
So when I was at
Goldman Sachs for years,

322
00:15:35,098 --> 00:15:36,200
we used to have a saying.

323
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,600
Volatility is our friend.

324
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,620
It's often not the friend of
many people in the markets.

325
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,270
But if you're in
the world of finance

326
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:47,450
or you're in the world of inter
mediating risk and holding

327
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:47,960
risks--

328
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:51,060
so volatility is a form of risk.

329
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:53,030
So volatility was
always our friend.

330
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,980
It was also our
friend, because often

331
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:57,380
if it was really
volatile, sometimes some

332
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:01,070
of our competitors would not
manage that risk as well.

333
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,780
And they would
lose market share,

334
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,540
and we would gain market share.

335
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,940
In fact, maybe they went
out of business, too.

336
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:11,080
But people like the volatility.

337
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,480
Startups can beg for
forgiveness afterwards.

338
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,180
Incumbents feel more
often, not always,

339
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,130
that they need to
ask for permission.

340
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:22,430
And so there's a little bit of
an asymmetric reputational risk

341
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:25,590
that goes on business-wise.

342
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,760
Now, once you're
at a big incumbent,

343
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,390
if you work for one
of the big places,

344
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:35,010
you'll feel that little bit
more constraint, a little bit

345
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:36,630
more compliance officers.

346
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:39,360
You're more lawyered, you
have more accountants.

347
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,560
But you should still
have the same values.

348
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:43,560
I say this sincerely.

349
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,690
Don't break the law.

350
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,370
No, no, sincerely.

351
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:49,360
But when you're at a
startup, you tend--

352
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,810
there's always some ambiguity,
and you take a little bit

353
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,940
more reputational risk.

354
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,690
You tend to.

355
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,790
So there's a bunch
of incumbents that

356
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:03,360
are trying to get in the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, Eurex,

357
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,760
Intercontinental Exchange,
which owns the New York Stock

358
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,260
Exchange.

359
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:09,930
We'll do a whole class
on what they're doing

360
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,900
there later in the semester.

361
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,210
Fidelity, that's spending
significant amount

362
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:19,310
of money looking
at it and others.

363
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:21,450
So the framework that
we've talked about,

364
00:17:21,450 --> 00:17:24,329
about guarding against
illicit activity, stability,

365
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:26,220
and the investing public--

366
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,230
I'm going to sort
through each of these,

367
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,700
but it's tax compliance.

368
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:34,810
No government wants to
shrink their tax base.

369
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:38,410
Now, some governments
want to attract activity

370
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:43,010
that shrinks the other
jurisdiction's tax base,

371
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:47,150
but it's not about shrinking
your own tax base usually.

372
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,090
I mean, you might
by law lower taxes,

373
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:53,090
but you're not
really looking to--

374
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:54,530
generally,
governments don't want

375
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:57,890
to promote whatever the
definition of illicit activity.

376
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,840
We don't need to define
that in this class.

377
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,570
It's a normative thing that
happens culture by culture,

378
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,750
jurisdiction by jurisdiction.

379
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:10,010
But there tends to be
something that's prohibited--

380
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:14,330
drug running, for instance,
child trafficking.

381
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,640
I mean, there are certain
things that are broadly

382
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,200
defined as illicit,
and then there's

383
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:23,180
some that changes depending
upon the culture and the society

384
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,730
and the times we're living in.

385
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,940
Terrorism financing, clearly.

386
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,440
And then sanctions, it's
a tool of foreign policy

387
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,180
that countries like our own,
but Europe and elsewhere

388
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,560
often use sanctions to try to--

389
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,320
it's centuries old.

390
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:43,670
It's called blockades in an
earlier century with the ships.

391
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:46,010
But now, we do it
more electronically

392
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:48,170
and commercially.

393
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:52,520
Financial stability tends
to be about the stability

394
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:56,780
of the overall economy
or the Fiat currency.

395
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:59,630
Or I put a little
second picture there,

396
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:02,780
the stability of the
commercial banking system.

397
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,990
So financial stability can
mean a lot of different things,

398
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:09,620
but it's usually about
the currency, the economy,

399
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:14,690
or the central bank system
and commercial bank system.

400
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:17,660
But to some countries,
not a majority,

401
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,280
some countries'
financial stability

402
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,590
is about capital controls.

403
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:25,970
If a country is controlling
somewhere the valuation

404
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,740
of their Fiat
currency-- remember,

405
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:30,320
we talked a lot about money.

406
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,230
But if some don't
want to flood and they

407
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,410
want to control the value
of their Fiat currency,

408
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:39,260
then they often have
capital controls.

409
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:44,240
And for those countries, this
whole world of crypto finance

410
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,680
touches on that.

411
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:49,070
And then the investing
public, the consuming public,

412
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:51,470
we'll talk about investor
protection and consumer

413
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:54,660
protection are not
exactly the same.

414
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,830
The two words market
integrity means basically

415
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:01,820
we promote economic activity
if you can have confidence

416
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,740
in central market structures.

417
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,700
Whether that's the
pricing of apples

418
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:11,380
or the pricing of
Apple stock, it's

419
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:14,020
in essence that there's
not fraud and manipulation

420
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,960
in that market.

421
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,090
And the more
transparent the prices

422
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:22,140
are both before you do a
transaction and after--

423
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,745
what's called
pre-trade transparency

424
00:20:23,745 --> 00:20:28,140
and post-trade transparency--
the more transparent

425
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,490
and the more you can root
out manipulation and fraud,

426
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:32,680
there's more integrity.

427
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:37,000
Usually very simply-- and this
is a lot of economic study goes

428
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,810
into it--

429
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:40,990
you lower the risk
premium in that market.

430
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:44,050
In essence, you can have more
confidence in that market.

431
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:46,180
And secondly, you
have more competition

432
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,780
in the price discovery function.

433
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,420
Aline?

434
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,253
AUDIENCE: It's really
a very silly question.

435
00:20:51,253 --> 00:20:54,310
But you said pre-transaction
transparency.

436
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,830
So how does that relate
to the United States

437
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,390
when you go to
the doctor and you

438
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:00,140
have no idea how much
you're going to pay?

439
00:21:02,332 --> 00:21:04,540
It seems like there's no
pre-transaction transparency

440
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,638
when you go to the doctor.

441
00:21:06,638 --> 00:21:08,680
GARY GENSLER: I tend to
agree with you that there

442
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,900
are many markets,
not just health care,

443
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,570
but there are many
markets where there's

444
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:17,320
limited pre-transaction
transparency.

445
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,650
I feel there's only limited
pre-transaction transparency

446
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:24,500
when I take my car
in to get worked on.

447
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,720
Now, of course, then they
give you some pricing

448
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,190
and the car is already
up on the platform.

449
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:34,520
And they're telling you
need your new brakes.

450
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,680
So yes, that's true.

451
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,250
Lots of different markets
operate in different ways.

452
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,680
And health care is
probably less transparent,

453
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,380
partly because it's
such a hybrid market

454
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,200
where we have third party
payment providers, insurance

455
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,960
companies, and governments
providing and paying

456
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,530
for a lot of our health care.

457
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:59,600
So economic activity
has a range.

458
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,960
In the financial
markets, market integrity

459
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,732
is boosted by a lot of
pre-trade transparency.

460
00:22:08,732 --> 00:22:13,190
Does that help a little?

461
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,860
So Mark Carney--
what did you all

462
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:19,040
take from Mark Carney's paper?

463
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,250
Anybody wants to volunteer, or
I can keep going down my list.

464
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,590
Rahim?

465
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,420
Did I get your name right?

466
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,830
What's that?

467
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,185
Riham.

468
00:22:29,185 --> 00:22:31,060
AUDIENCE: I'm talking
about the [INAUDIBLE]..

469
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:35,060
GARY GENSLER: So one
thing that Mark Carney

470
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,590
said is he didn't
really consider

471
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:39,680
cryptocurrencies currencies,
but they were an asset.

472
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,176
What else did Mark say?

473
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:44,293
AUDIENCE: My name's
Matt Doherty.

474
00:22:44,293 --> 00:22:45,460
GARY GENSLER: Thalita, Matt.

475
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,540
AUDIENCE: One of
the reasons he said

476
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:54,140
it wasn't a currency was because
of the extreme volatility that

477
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,900
meant it had no intrinsic
value, which I disagreed with.

478
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,410
I didn't think that
volatility should equate

479
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:01,630
to a lack of intrinsic value.

480
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,630
GARY GENSLER: All right.

481
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:06,380
So Matt's raising that Mark
Carney says, well, volatility

482
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,270
can't be a currency.

483
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:11,830
I tend to agree with Matt.

484
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:14,665
And if Mark were here, I'd
say it to him directly.

485
00:23:14,665 --> 00:23:16,040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
stocks that

486
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,230
are extremely
volatile, but yet still

487
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,605
haven't been
devalued [INAUDIBLE]..

488
00:23:20,605 --> 00:23:21,980
GARY GENSLER: I
would say there's

489
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:27,260
even some Fiat currencies that
have been pretty volatile.

490
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:31,280
AUDIENCE: So I think that it
does have intrinsic value,

491
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,830
but maybe not necessarily
be a currency if it's not

492
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,550
a dependable unit of account,
if it's always fluctuating.

493
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,890
And that was my take anyway.

494
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:42,720
So I agree, but it's just a
different line of reasoning

495
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,555
why I don't think--

496
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:45,090
GARY GENSLER: So you think
it's a different reason

497
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,257
that it has intrinsic value.

498
00:23:46,257 --> 00:23:48,215
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think
it has intrinsic value,

499
00:23:48,215 --> 00:23:50,760
I just think that it should
be called a digital asset, not

500
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,530
because it doesn't
have intrinsic value,

501
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,963
but because it's not a
dependable unit of account.

502
00:23:54,963 --> 00:23:56,380
GARY GENSLER: And
your first name?

503
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,005
I'm sorry.

504
00:23:57,005 --> 00:23:57,380
AUDIENCE: Kyle.

505
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,172
GARY GENSLER: Kyle.

506
00:23:58,172 --> 00:24:00,240
So Kyle's saying that
it's because it's not

507
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,100
a dependable unit of account.

508
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,520
And very few places have
used it as a unit of account

509
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,900
at this point in time.

510
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:11,820
Matt-- it's good, we're
going to have a debate here.

511
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,985
AUDIENCE: But the fact
that places have used it

512
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:18,290
as a unit of account should make
it so that it is a currency.

513
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,820
It has been used as a
currency in the past.

514
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:24,685
And whether five people use
it or a million people use it,

515
00:24:24,685 --> 00:24:26,060
shouldn't the fact
that it can be

516
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,580
used qualify it to be a
currency, whether it's

517
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:31,288
to a certain amount of people
shouldn't necessarily matter.

518
00:24:31,288 --> 00:24:33,080
GARY GENSLER: And so
who wants to arbitrate

519
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:37,310
between Matt and Kyle?

520
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,727
Leonardo.

521
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:41,060
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I wanted to
give an example of countries

522
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,950
where there is super
high inflation, where

523
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:48,120
their domestic currencies
lose what it's really worth.

524
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,820
So people actually
automatically start

525
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:53,360
to use dollars, for example,
as their reference account.

526
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,730
So it can be
functional in the sense

527
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:58,640
that people can still
exchange, but you can't really

528
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,107
measure until you peg
to something else.

529
00:25:01,107 --> 00:25:03,440
And actually, Bitcoin's pegged
to the value of something

530
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,320
else today.

531
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,490
And that's where I think
the value of accounts--

532
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:12,053
I'll be on the left side camp.

533
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:13,220
GARY GENSLER: So it depends.

534
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,670
And if it's in a country with
hyperinflation, and I don't--

535
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:18,650
I hope not-- have
any of you lived

536
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:22,320
in a country with hyperinflation
in your lifetimes?

537
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,340
So five or six of you have.

538
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:30,030
So you know what it is like
when you go into a restaurant

539
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,380
there's one set of pricing.

540
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:34,110
But if you eat for too long
and linger at the table,

541
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,940
it's different level of pricing.

542
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,303
Literally, right?

543
00:25:37,303 --> 00:25:38,970
AUDIENCE: You get
your paycheck one day,

544
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:41,760
then you have to spend it
as fast as you can, because

545
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:47,505
in a week, that's basically a
fraction of what you were paid.

546
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:49,880
GARY GENSLER: But from the
view from the top, what Mark--

547
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,600
one quote from the paper that
I took was that authorities,

548
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,680
thinking about--

549
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,620
this is from a public
policy perspective.

550
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,360
Authorities need
to decide, are you

551
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:04,460
going to isolate this world,
regulate it, integrate it?

552
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,510
Now, some countries--
I don't think anybody's

553
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,800
fully isolated it.

554
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,330
But some countries,
in a sense, have

555
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:12,210
said, let's ban a
lot of this activity.

556
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:14,043
And Kelly?

557
00:26:14,043 --> 00:26:15,460
AUDIENCE: Can I
ask to what extent

558
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,740
are other countries looking
to comments like this

559
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:21,353
to decide what stance
they're going to take?

560
00:26:21,353 --> 00:26:22,770
GARY GENSLER:
Kelly's question is,

561
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:26,220
so to what extent to comments
from a Mark Carney who's

562
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:28,128
the governor of the
Bank of England,

563
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,420
but heads the Financial
Stability Board-- how much does

564
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:35,670
that influence the rest of
the official sector community?

565
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:36,880
And it's a great question.

566
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,030
I think that it all
goes into the mix.

567
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:46,620
I think that there's probably
in any public policy sphere

568
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:51,030
six to a dozen
countries that really

569
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:57,120
take the lead, not legally.

570
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,620
They're not taking
the lead legally,

571
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:01,110
they're just taking
the lead because others

572
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:07,090
follow that which is said in the
US, the European Union, China,

573
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:08,010
Japan.

574
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:13,050
I mean, we know the usual
and the normal countries.

575
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:17,010
But part of it is because
the depth and breadth

576
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:21,730
of their economies,
part of it in this world

577
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:24,370
the depth and breadth of
their financial markets.

578
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:27,130
But it's also because
often their opinion

579
00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:31,720
leaders and their opinions
are somewhat respected.

580
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,600
But we have 180
or 190 countries.

581
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,030
And each one of them
has a different culture,

582
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,130
and each has a different
political system,

583
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:43,690
and a different history, and
different economic well-being.

584
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:48,760
So I went into the international
arena doing regulation thinking

585
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:53,890
it would it is a dystopian
view that there's

586
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:58,540
going to be one worldwide regime
for almost any public policy

587
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:01,120
issue.

588
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,790
I mean, I don't know if it
exists in almost any place.

589
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,880
But when you get to
financial services,

590
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,690
it's pretty unlikely because
of all those different cultures

591
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:14,260
and histories and political
systems and economies

592
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,680
clashing up against each other.

593
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,310
Yes?

594
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:18,560
AUDIENCE: I was just wondering
if you can explain more

595
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,480
about what you mean by
China leading the effort--

596
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,620
GARY GENSLER: China's--

597
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:26,800
AUDIENCE: Is leading the effort
in regulating the blockchain,

598
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,130
because China has banned
the exchange of Fiat

599
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:31,550
money [INAUDIBLE].

600
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:34,400
GARY GENSLER: So the
question is China.

601
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:40,930
So how many in the room think
China would be in the isolate--

602
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:43,540
dominantly in the isolate
category rather than

603
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:47,350
the integrate category?

604
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:49,170
So a quarter or a third.

605
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:49,890
It's interesting.

606
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:50,970
It's really a hybrid.

607
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:56,800
China came pretty strongly
saying no to a lot of activity.

608
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,390
And yet, two of the biggest
mining poles for Bitcoin

609
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:02,430
are in China.

610
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:05,340
Some of the crypto
exchanges left China,

611
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:09,180
but those miners are the
biggest sellers of Bitcoin,

612
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,890
because they're
collecting the Bitcoin

613
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:14,790
and need to sell them, have
to find some crypto exchange

614
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:18,390
somewhere that is
no longer in China.

615
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,610
I'm going to mispronounce
the name of the exchange.

616
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:28,320
But Huobi, H-U-O-B-I, is still
very much a Chinese crypto

617
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,160
exchange.

618
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,980
I think it's now
registered in Malta

619
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,940
if I'm not mistaken maybe.

620
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:39,390
So there's a love-hate hybrid.

621
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:43,680
The Central Bank of China
has very active projects

622
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,620
with regard to
blockchain technology.

623
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:50,290
And they have a whole
lab and it's public.

624
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:52,170
That which is public is public.

625
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:54,150
That which is private
probably is bigger

626
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:55,960
and we just don't know about it.

627
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:01,560
So there's a bit of a mixed
approach even in China,

628
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:05,370
if that answers your question.

629
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:07,770
So let me just go--

630
00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:10,200
I've spent a lot of time
in the last six months

631
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,850
traveling around the
globe and speaking

632
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:17,760
at different conferences, OECD,
in Japan, and here in the US.

633
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,940
What I see-- guarding
against illicit activity,

634
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,470
broad consensus.

635
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:26,190
180-190 countries, yeah,
we've got to do it.

636
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:30,560
Really choppy performance
on implementation,

637
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:34,310
and sometimes a little bit of a
head fake from one jurisdiction

638
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:36,080
to another, because
some actually

639
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,690
are fine with tax
evasion as long as it's

640
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:43,090
tax evasion in the other
person's jurisdiction.

641
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:46,270
Usually, low
population centers are

642
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:49,720
more comfortable promoting
being tax havens,

643
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,480
trying to take economic
activity from elsewhere.

644
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,720
But there's general
broad consensus

645
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,390
and it's usually centered
on finance ministries

646
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:01,690
and central bank authorities
and the equivalent

647
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:04,930
of law enforcement,
our Justice Department.

648
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:05,650
Think of those.

649
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:09,930
That's where the nexus is
happening country by country.

650
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:14,100
Financial stability, general
consensus to monitor--

651
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:17,130
there's not a deep
worry right now,

652
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:21,270
because the space is only a
quarter of a trillion dollars.

653
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:23,880
And the worldwide
capital markets--

654
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,820
the worldwide debt
markets are $250 trillion,

655
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,760
nearly 1,000 times bigger.

656
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,960
And the worldwide equity
markets are about $90 trillion.

657
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:38,700
And even the worldwide stock
of gold, at $7 trillion,

658
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,450
is nearly 30 times as large.

659
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:48,540
It just gives you a sense of
the relationship right now why

660
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:53,790
let's monitor, but it's probably
not systemic destabilizing.

661
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:55,860
However, there's
different perspectives,

662
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:58,920
particularly in countries
that have capital controls,

663
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:02,400
because it could be
destabilizing to a currency

664
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,720
in that way.

665
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,940
And then thirdly, the
investing public--

666
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,470
protecting investing
public, I would

667
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:10,050
say the views are wide ranging.

668
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:12,720
In the US and
Canada, more forward

669
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,560
leaning, more a
lot of this stuff--

670
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,900
maybe these initial
coin offerings

671
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:23,340
are securities that
need to be protected.

672
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,960
And in a bunch of
other countries,

673
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,590
it's like let 1,000
flowers bloom.

674
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:30,960
Let's promote
innovation and so forth.

675
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,470
And it's a pretty wide view.

676
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:37,860
My personal view is, and I've
said this at some conferences,

677
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:48,020
if this grew from a quarter of
a to five and 10 and 20 times

678
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:52,070
the size, or if the ICO
marketplace, which has raised

679
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:57,130
about $20 to $25 billion
today, kept raising that

680
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:00,140
but went to like $100
billion a year raise,

681
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,860
then a bunch of
countries would probably

682
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,020
want more investor protection.

683
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:07,330
I think-- this is just
my personal view--

684
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:11,970
we will never have uniform
jurisdiction, uniform laws.

685
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:14,610
But part of what's going
on is this is so new

686
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:19,150
and it's still relatively small
versus the capital markets.

687
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:22,110
If it grew, I think
more countries

688
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:24,633
would want some protection.

689
00:33:24,633 --> 00:33:27,050
AUDIENCE: I have a question
regarding the illicit equities

690
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:28,505
and financial stability.

691
00:33:28,505 --> 00:33:29,880
As you traveled
to other country,

692
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:34,050
what metrics were they using
to measure their success

693
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:36,215
or monitor on those fronts?

694
00:33:36,215 --> 00:33:38,340
GARY GENSLER: So the question
is what are countries

695
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,377
doing to measure for success.

696
00:33:40,377 --> 00:33:42,210
I'm going to use one
example, and then we'll

697
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:44,220
keep going into the details.

698
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:49,350
Japan had some of the
earliest crypto exchanges, Mt.

699
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:51,660
Gox, G-O-X. Mt.

700
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:56,190
Gox was an early exchange
that the promoters, the owners

701
00:33:56,190 --> 00:34:01,080
moved to Tokyo, even though
they weren't Japanese nationals.

702
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,530
So it was it was
centered in Tokyo.

703
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:08,760
And it went down when about
half a billion dollars of value

704
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,960
was lost.

705
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:14,460
It was supposedly a
hack, stolen crypto.

706
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,480
It was aan interesting case.

707
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,929
It was actually being
stolen over many months.

708
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:21,480
It wasn't one specific hack.

709
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:27,659
So Japan in 2017 finally got
around and changed their laws.

710
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:33,100
And they put in a whole regime
to regulate crypto exchanges,

711
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:37,530
particularly around this
customer protection custody

712
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:40,139
issue and around
illicit activity.

713
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:43,020
And they actually have
gone in and asked exchanges

714
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,250
to register.

715
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:49,350
They go in and actually
do examinations.

716
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:51,540
And earlier this
year, of the, I think,

717
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:54,449
30 some registered
exchanges, five

718
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:57,780
or 10 had to cease operations.

719
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:01,420
How do they measure
success or failure?

720
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,630
Another exchange in
January of this year

721
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:07,770
lost another half a
billion dollars to a hack.

722
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:12,030
Their principal executive,
their prime minister,

723
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:14,340
got a question in
a news conference.

724
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:18,670
If you're a regulator,
that's not a good thing.

725
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:22,980
So sometimes, you measure
success or failure

726
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:28,440
as to whether your boss gets a
question in a news conference

727
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,390
about why it's not working.

728
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:32,760
The Japanese have been
terrific, by the way,

729
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,110
in terms of what they're doing.

730
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:38,400
But I'm just using that as
an example of sometimes.

731
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:44,060
So let me just chat about a
deep dive into each of these

732
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,800
in probably five
or 10 minutes each,

733
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,800
which you could do a whole
course on each of these.

734
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,990
But let me just deep
dive a little bit.

735
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:55,590
Guarding against
illicit activity--

736
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:59,550
so tax compliance and
reporting, what do you

737
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:02,100
think the first big question
that the US government

738
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,980
or any government--
this sounds US-centric.

739
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,750
And Kelly, I thank
you for your paper,

740
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,925
because Kelly-- is
it all right if I

741
00:36:08,925 --> 00:36:11,175
call you out-- wrote a paper
for today, which I happen

742
00:36:11,175 --> 00:36:14,400
to read earlier today and
said Gensler's work was

743
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,345
too US-centric.

744
00:36:17,657 --> 00:36:18,615
I thought it was gutsy.

745
00:36:18,615 --> 00:36:19,760
I thought it was gutsy.

746
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,580
But you're right.

747
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,780
It was US-centric.

748
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:25,050
I was speaking to
the US Congress.

749
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,270
So that was this thing you
learn in politics, too.

750
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,780
You try to gauge your audience.

751
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,230
But you were right.

752
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,330
But what do you
think the first thing

753
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:35,600
whether it's the US government
or any government's got

754
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:40,800
to figure out in terms of this
world came along in 2010, 2011,

755
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,910
2012-- what was that
first question, which

756
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:46,740
you may have teased
out of the readings,

757
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:49,670
but as a policy question?

758
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:53,610
Anybody want to take a guess?

759
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:56,505
AUDIENCE: How do you
treat it for tax purposes?

760
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,630
GARY GENSLER: How do you
treat it for tax purposes?

761
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:04,130
How do you treat Bitcoin at
the time for tax purposes?

762
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:06,620
And so that central
question was the first thing

763
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,060
that really came up.

764
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,170
Is it a currency?

765
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:10,640
Is it a form of property?

766
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,350
Is it something else?

767
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:16,460
What did the US government say
back in, I think it was 2013?

768
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:19,580
But it would it be
in the testimony.

769
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,090
What is it?

770
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:22,130
Is it a currency or property?

771
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:22,940
AUDIENCE: Property.

772
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:23,720
GARY GENSLER: Property.

773
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,137
AUDIENCE: It makes
for a pain when

774
00:37:25,137 --> 00:37:27,740
you're filling out your taxes
and you do any sort of trading.

775
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,865
GARY GENSLER: That's right.

776
00:37:28,865 --> 00:37:31,453
So the result of that is--
you want to say it again?

777
00:37:31,453 --> 00:37:32,870
AUDIENCE: You have
to-- basically,

778
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:36,140
every time you exchange
to another currency

779
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:40,660
or you spend it, you have
to record the cost basis.

780
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:43,240
And yeah, if you do any
sort of my tax return,

781
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,860
was 600 pages this year.

782
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,940
it's pretty brutal.

783
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:50,690
So any time it changes at
all, you can't consolidate--

784
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:53,360
I think it's like with
stocks you can consolidate.

785
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,820
If it's the same security
being traded over the year,

786
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:59,390
you can consolidate to show
your beginning and ending

787
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:01,050
and just pay tax on the delta.

788
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:03,952
But you have to report
every single trade.

789
00:38:03,952 --> 00:38:05,660
GARY GENSLER: So these
types of questions

790
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:08,900
were not known in 2008
when Satoshi Nakamoto wrote

791
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:09,440
his paper.

792
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,550
But 10 years later, is it
currency, is it property?

793
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:17,300
Some jurisdictions around
the globe, very few but some,

794
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:20,040
have said its currency.

795
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,840
But almost dominantly
around the globe,

796
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:26,340
it's some form of property,
and then within the laws

797
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,990
triggers, like it
does in the US,

798
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:31,210
capital gains and
so forth like that.

799
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:34,000
The next quote set
of questions was,

800
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,110
what's the tax treatment of
mining, exchanges, and forks?

801
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:40,120
Anybody want to tell me--

802
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:45,580
if you're mining and you receive
Bitcoin or any other crypto,

803
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:50,290
Ether, and so forth--

804
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:52,130
anybody want to take a guess?

805
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:53,070
It's not a guess.

806
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:55,660
I think it was even in
the testimony I wrote.

807
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,455
You had 600 pages.

808
00:38:57,455 --> 00:38:58,955
AUDIENCE: I know
with a fork anyway,

809
00:38:58,955 --> 00:39:00,780
you basically pay tax
on the whole thing.

810
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:06,040
So a Bitcoin cash fork,
basically the cost basis

811
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,650
is zero, and whatever its
value at the time you sell it.

812
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:11,650
GARY GENSLER: You're
saying you had to pay taxes

813
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,190
on both sides of the fork?

814
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:13,930
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

815
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:16,540
GARY GENSLER: So that's
rougher than a stock split.

816
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:19,360
A stock split, you
just carryover basis.

817
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,610
How about Bitcoin mining?

818
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:21,110
Anybody?

819
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,722
Zan, you want to take it?

820
00:39:22,722 --> 00:39:24,430
AUDIENCE: I actually
don't know this one,

821
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:27,235
but I would assume they
treat it like income.

822
00:39:27,235 --> 00:39:28,110
GARY GENSLER: Income.

823
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:28,960
Zan's right.

824
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,160
It's income.

825
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,620
You mine, you get income.

826
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:37,660
So each of these had to be
addressed in the tax law.

827
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:40,140
The next thing is something
called the Bank Secrecy Act.

828
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:43,870
Anybody want to tell me what
the Bank Secrecy Act is?

829
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:46,030
Is it Nicholas?

830
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:49,763
See, I can read your name
there and see how that worked.

831
00:39:49,763 --> 00:39:51,180
AUDIENCE: I'm not
sure what it is.

832
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,638
GARY GENSLER: OK,
that's all right.

833
00:39:52,638 --> 00:39:56,490
Bank Secrecy Act was passed
a few decades ago so probably

834
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:58,320
before most of us in this room--

835
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,870
after I was born, but
most of you were born.

836
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:05,370
Anybody want to say what
the Bank Secrecy Act is?

837
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:06,060
Daniel?

838
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:09,020
AUDIENCE: Is it the Bank Secrecy
Act that deals with KYC and AML

839
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,610
and essentially
knowing the parties

840
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:11,920
that you're interacting with?

841
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,570
GARY GENSLER: Correct.

842
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:13,195
That's correct.

843
00:40:13,195 --> 00:40:17,220
It's really trying to protect
against secret transactions

844
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:20,640
or what's often called
money laundering.

845
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,740
And behind the money
laundering laws

846
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:25,290
is knowing who the
customer is of a bank.

847
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:29,750
So you'll hear these letters,
KYC, know your customer;

848
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:33,430
AML, anti-money laundering.

849
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:35,710
And the Bank Secrecy
Act, underneath it then,

850
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:38,110
has reporting
obligations that anyone

851
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:41,350
who has to report under
the Bank Secrecy Act

852
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:45,040
has to report when there's
large transactions.

853
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:49,060
If you go into the bank and
you ask them, can you please--

854
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:54,190
I want to take a withdraw
of $11,000 of US currency.

855
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:56,560
They have to fill out
a report, because I

856
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,470
believe the triggers $10,000.

857
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:03,630
You walk in and you
get $500, no report.

858
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:06,960
But there's various
suspicious activity reporting

859
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,510
and other large
transaction reporting

860
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:12,085
that gets triggered in
the US Bank Secrecy Act.

861
00:41:12,085 --> 00:41:13,710
But you will hear
over and over again--

862
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:16,830
even if you never invest or
work in a blockchain company,

863
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:20,100
you will hear something
called KYC and AML.

864
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:25,920
And it's these two
regimes that kind of work.

865
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,430
They're not the best,
but they do their job

866
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:32,470
to give the official sector
and the banking sector

867
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:36,430
a sense of who owns the
accounts and when there's

868
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:40,300
suspicious activity that
there's a reporting obligation

869
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,890
into the authorities.

870
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:42,390
Aline?

871
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:45,310
AUDIENCE: So how do anonymous
cryptocurrencies fit in here?

872
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:48,750
I suppose at the exchange
level you do KYC and AML.

873
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:52,520
GARY GENSLER: So Aline is asking
how does everything fit in.

874
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,150
So how does money transmission
laws-- money transmission

875
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:58,930
laws are the laws that were
just mentioned by Daniel,

876
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:00,520
the anti-money laundering.

877
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:04,090
CTF is counter-terrorism
finance.

878
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:08,170
I mean, Washington is a
world full of these letters

879
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:10,750
and jargon and everything.

880
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:11,980
So how does it fit in?

881
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:16,600
It first is one of the things in
the US Department of Treasury--

882
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:18,640
but again, to
internationalize it--

883
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,970
other departments of treasury
and so forth around the globe

884
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:27,330
define when do you come
under the similar laws.

885
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:30,760
When are you just a
user of this property,

886
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,470
because it's not a currency?

887
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:35,140
But to confuse matters, the
US Department of treasury

888
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:39,670
said it was a virtual currency,
a virtual currency which

889
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:42,580
happens to be
property for tax law.

890
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:44,500
This is two parts of
the same department.

891
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,600
The US Department of
treasury said it's property

892
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,800
not currency.

893
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,410
Another part of the US Treasury
said it's virtual currency.

894
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:54,010
And the reason they had to
say it was virtual currency

895
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:58,780
is they wanted it to come under
this law, the Bank Secrecy Act,

896
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:01,950
without going probably to
Congress to have it be amended.

897
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:04,050
Hugo?

898
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:05,560
AUDIENCE: So
cryptocurrency is given

899
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:09,610
a bad rap for money
laundering, but what

900
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:14,410
about [INAUDIBLE]
this year, I think

901
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:18,490
some bank was fined for money
laundering over $200 billion.

902
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:20,740
And the amount of money going
through crypto exchanges

903
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:22,617
is in the maybe $10 million.

904
00:43:22,617 --> 00:43:24,450
GARY GENSLER: So Hugo's
asking the question,

905
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:27,430
well, wait, crypto is getting
a bad rap for money laundering,

906
00:43:27,430 --> 00:43:28,820
what about everything else?

907
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:31,300
And I'd say, yes, what
Hugo is reminding us

908
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:35,290
of is criminals don't change,
just the technologies they

909
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:36,460
use do change.

910
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:40,870
But they're still using bags
of cash in some jurisdictions

911
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:46,010
and there's still suitcases and
cast drops around the globe.

912
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:50,440
I'm told that there's even now
some trafficking between crypto

913
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:53,260
and physical cash
where couriers can

914
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:58,660
be paid a certain percentage
to take suitcases of cash

915
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:02,450
from, let's say, drug
runners on the one hand

916
00:44:02,450 --> 00:44:05,800
and exchange them a thumb drive
or a private key with Bitcoin

917
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:09,700
on the other, so just
new means and methods.

918
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:10,600
Sorry?

919
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,740
AUDIENCE: I would
just reply that I

920
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:15,770
would say that the amount
that that bank was charged

921
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:17,660
was probably a
small portion of it,

922
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:22,100
whereas there is probably a
higher proportion potentially

923
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:26,387
of cryptocurrency
that has illicit uses.

924
00:44:26,387 --> 00:44:28,220
GARY GENSLER: So
Christopher is saying maybe

925
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:30,860
there's a higher
percentage of crypto

926
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:35,060
that's being used for illicit
than the percent of Fiat.

927
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:37,700
That may well be correct,
because the world's stock

928
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:41,150
of Fiat is measured in
the tens of trillions.

929
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:44,460
But that may be, but it's
still something that concerns,

930
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:51,200
because like water wants
to find the lowest level

931
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,610
and will drain up
wherever the leak is,

932
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:59,570
illicit activity will flow
to wherever the lowest level.

933
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:02,500
So the challenges, the
key challenges-- you all

934
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:05,330
have raised many of these, so
I'm not going to ask questions.

935
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:07,880
But the pseudonymous
addresses, that is

936
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:11,660
a real challenge for law
enforcement around the globe.

937
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:16,400
Privacy coins, like what we
talked about Zcash and Monaro

938
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:21,830
and so forth, that have
a cryptographic method

939
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:24,440
to make it harder to track.

940
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:29,540
And then compliance
and reporting,

941
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:32,030
there just isn't a lot
of-- even well meaning

942
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:36,020
people don't often comply
and put in the 600 pages.

943
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:36,960
The US government.

944
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,130
Thanks you.

945
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:40,310
AUDIENCE: I'm waiting
for my audit to come.

946
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:41,393
GARY GENSLER: What's that?

947
00:45:41,393 --> 00:45:43,250
You're waiting for
your audit to come.

948
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:47,030
I would say the other
challenges are also--

949
00:45:47,030 --> 00:45:49,310
these are the things that
the regulators and law

950
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:50,720
enforcement talk about.

951
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,910
Crypto to crypto
transactions are

952
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:56,000
a little bit more challenging
than crypto to Fiat.

953
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,440
Does anybody want to--

954
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,810
Zan, why?

955
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:03,510
AUDIENCE: It seems to me that,
from a regulator perspective,

956
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:07,800
it's fairly easy to regulate
and monitor the on-ramps

957
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:08,780
and off-ramps, right?

958
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:11,460
So when you're dealing with
financial intermediaries,

959
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,530
you're essentially
bringing Fiat into crypto

960
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:14,940
and you can monitor
a transaction

961
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:15,857
or if it's coming out.

962
00:46:15,857 --> 00:46:18,960
But what happens within the
ecosystem, especially when you

963
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,420
bring in Monaro and some
of these privacy coins,

964
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:22,470
regulators have no idea.

965
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:24,240
So it's really hard.

966
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,510
GARY GENSLER: So this term,
on-ramps and off-ramps

967
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:32,100
I've heard a lot, not
just from Zan, but that's

968
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:34,350
how law enforcement
thinks about it.

969
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:37,950
Because they're regulating
the intermediary caught-backs,

970
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:41,840
back to the discussion we
had about 30 minutes ago,

971
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:46,220
regulated intermediaries
give the official sector

972
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:49,940
a node to influence behavior.

973
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:54,500
They have the banks, the JP
Morgans and the small community

974
00:46:54,500 --> 00:47:00,080
banks, in this system of
Bank Secrecy Act compliance.

975
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:03,920
And even though some are doing
sloppy work, as Hugo pointed

976
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,080
out, they're in the system.

977
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:11,750
And so crypto to crypto is
harder for the official sector,

978
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:16,110
because they don't need
any commercial bank.

979
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:18,350
Or in a sense,
crypto to crypto is

980
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:23,270
easier for somebody that wants
to stay off the tax base,

981
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:26,820
because there's not
the same reporting.

982
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:31,060
So it depends on which side
of the lens you're on as well.

983
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:34,220
Decentralized exchanges
we're going to talk about

984
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:37,430
in about five or six classes.

985
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:41,740
But trust me, they're harder
for the official sector.

986
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:44,050
Decentralized exchanges
are basically--

987
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:48,390
think of an algorithm
that is decentralized,

988
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:50,310
no central intermediary.

989
00:47:50,310 --> 00:47:53,880
But through an
algorithm, Ilan and I

990
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:58,360
could trade Bitcoin versus
Ether, Ether versus Bitcoin.

991
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:02,030
And this decentralized
exchange allows it to happen.

992
00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:08,620
Most of them right now are
between two tokens that

993
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:14,610
are on Ethereum, so Ethereum
token into Ethereum, token two

994
00:48:14,610 --> 00:48:16,570
ICO tokens.

995
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:20,410
But they're a real challenge
and we'll get to them later.

996
00:48:20,410 --> 00:48:23,470
Anybody know what
a dark market is?

997
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:25,960
I'm not going to ask if
anybody's used a dark market.

998
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,040
Don't worry.

999
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,318
Does anybody know?

1000
00:48:28,318 --> 00:48:29,950
AUDIENCE: I think
like the Silk Road.

1001
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:31,040
GARY GENSLER: Silk Road.

1002
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,260
It is Silk Road.

1003
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:34,435
But what is Silk Road?

1004
00:48:34,435 --> 00:48:38,350
AUDIENCE: It was somebody
using the deep web.

1005
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:40,960
The guy's in jail right now.

1006
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:44,410
And he had the
idea of free trade

1007
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:48,790
and it was used
for drugs mainly.

1008
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:51,400
GARY GENSLER: So it's
basically a website where

1009
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,700
you can buy and
sell illegal things,

1010
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:58,120
not just drugs but
primarily drugs.

1011
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:03,340
And the payments were
generally in Bitcoin,

1012
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:06,850
even though some have
moved on from Bitcoin now.

1013
00:49:06,850 --> 00:49:09,460
And the technology
they were using

1014
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:15,670
was a TOR, T-O-R, which
is a way that you could

1015
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:18,370
do communications on the
web and not be tracked,

1016
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:21,850
I mean broadly speaking.

1017
00:49:21,850 --> 00:49:23,230
So that was Silk Road.

1018
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:25,640
And dark markets exist.

1019
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:28,390
Again, before Bitcoin,
dark markets exist.

1020
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:30,190
They might have been
called black markets.

1021
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:31,320
So they have a new name.

1022
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,160
They're a new technology.

1023
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:36,100
And then state actors--

1024
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:39,880
and no one should doubt
that state actors are always

1025
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:43,910
in some competition
with each other.

1026
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:45,670
And even if we're
not in a hot war,

1027
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:49,700
sometimes you're in other
types of competition.

1028
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:52,690
And so state actors
are also using--

1029
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:57,580
and not just like the Mueller
investigation saw that--

1030
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:00,580
they alleged that Russians
were using Bitcoin

1031
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:04,010
to mess in our elections.

1032
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:06,340
But in a more broad
sense, state actors

1033
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:09,040
could play in this space.

1034
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,950
I just thought this
chart was interesting.

1035
00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:13,140
I found it on a website.

1036
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:14,020
Diar did a report.

1037
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:18,070
But this is US Agency Contracts
for Blockchain Analysis.

1038
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:21,430
There's companies out there
that will go in and do

1039
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:23,700
the forensics and analysis.

1040
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:26,260
And here is the
highest agencies.

1041
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:29,440
These numbers aren't
terribly relevant

1042
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,890
that it's $2 million or $2.5
million, but it's interesting.

1043
00:50:32,890 --> 00:50:38,560
It's the IRS, it's the customs,
FBI, and the Fiscal Services,

1044
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,660
and the Drug Enforcement Agency.

1045
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:43,960
That's the parts of the
US that have publicly

1046
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:48,730
done requests for contracts
so this outside service could

1047
00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:49,370
track it.

1048
00:50:49,370 --> 00:50:52,060
But it just gives a
flavor for who's chasing

1049
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:55,000
after Bitcoin usage in the US.

1050
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,110
It's wonderful transparency.

1051
00:50:58,110 --> 00:50:59,437
That's illicit activity.

1052
00:50:59,437 --> 00:51:01,020
Let me move on to
financial stability,

1053
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:04,110
because we're going
to run out of time.

1054
00:51:04,110 --> 00:51:07,350
Financial stability--
the initial assessment

1055
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:12,580
of the Financial Stability
Board is not big enough yet.

1056
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:15,430
I would say though, again,
capital control companies

1057
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:17,620
are worried about
maintaining stability.

1058
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:22,420
That's if it could undermine
your currency value.

1059
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:26,410
In essence, a capital
control country,

1060
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:29,510
where China has some capital
controls for instance,

1061
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:33,010
you can't get a lot
of the currency out.

1062
00:51:33,010 --> 00:51:40,530
But if you can go Renminbi to
Bitcoin, Bitcoin to dollar,

1063
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:42,990
then it's basically
a bridge currency

1064
00:51:42,990 --> 00:51:45,060
to avoid capital controls.

1065
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,400
And one of the things I
understand the Bank of China

1066
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:52,200
is focused on is that with
the big miners in China

1067
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,900
that, in essence, the
mining operations are a way

1068
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:57,270
to get around capital controls.

1069
00:51:57,270 --> 00:52:02,490
It's a way to change Renminbi
into electricity, electricity

1070
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:06,825
into Bitcoin, Bitcoin
into dollars or euros.

1071
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,810
But it may also be why some
local officials in China

1072
00:52:13,810 --> 00:52:17,750
apparently are allowing
the mining to continue.

1073
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:21,380
And while I don't have
any documented proof,

1074
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:23,540
it's why some people think
that there's probably

1075
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:27,560
some arrangements with
these local officials.

1076
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:34,440
I mentioned three other
areas in the testimony

1077
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:38,190
that I think are on the horizon
that are worth thinking about.

1078
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:41,400
Crypto leverage-- a lot
of the crypto exchanges

1079
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,850
provide a lot of leverage.

1080
00:52:42,850 --> 00:52:48,000
You can buy Bitcoin, in
some cases 100 to 1 levered.

1081
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,180
Most or not at 100 to 1, but
almost all are at least 10 to 1

1082
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:55,370
says our trader, right?

1083
00:52:55,370 --> 00:52:58,040
So leverage often
is where you can

1084
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:02,300
get more acceleration
of a crisis

1085
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:07,220
if it's already happening,
more systemic risk.

1086
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:09,290
This still is a
rather small market,

1087
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:11,030
but the leverages,
probably something

1088
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:15,140
could propagate any crisis
if it were to happen.

1089
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:16,940
The market
infrastructure itself,

1090
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:20,870
like Australia is using
blockchain technology

1091
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:24,663
to do their clearing and
settlement of stocks.

1092
00:53:24,663 --> 00:53:26,330
They haven't adopted
it yet, but they're

1093
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:29,630
rolling it out next
year and into 2020,

1094
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:33,260
so just making sure the
infrastructure works.

1095
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:35,370
And then central bank
digital currency--

1096
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:38,660
so we're going to do two
lectures on central bank

1097
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:39,680
digital currencies.

1098
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,510
And I probably should've
just skip this slide.

1099
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:46,280
But here are some of the
concerns around central bank

1100
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:47,820
digital currencies.

1101
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:49,880
It could be pro cyclical.

1102
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:51,920
A central bank
digital currency means

1103
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:57,180
the central bank
says Joaquin does not

1104
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:59,730
have to deposit at a
bank to have US dollars.

1105
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:03,580
He can deposit straight
with the Federal Reserve.

1106
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:06,010
Or in Sweden, it's
close enough to do it.

1107
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:09,310
You can deposit straight with
the Swedish central bank.

1108
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:11,450
We'll talk about this
more in a couple of weeks.

1109
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:15,670
But that could lead to runs
away from commercial banks

1110
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:16,890
to central banks.

1111
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:20,680
AUDIENCE: I think my key
question is, if you do so,

1112
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:24,280
you run the central bank
digital currency on parallel

1113
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:25,730
to its Fiat currency.

1114
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:28,120
And that would
jeopardize the ability

1115
00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:30,550
that the central bank
would be able to carry out

1116
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:34,280
monetary policy, especially
if you use Bitcoin in a way

1117
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:39,010
that the supply is rigid, the
ability for you to actually

1118
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:44,580
carry out for the
likes of [INAUDIBLE]??

1119
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:46,630
GARY GENSLER: Remind
me your first name?

1120
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:47,380
Sean.

1121
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:49,810
So Sean, I agree with Sean.

1122
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:51,392
Can you hold that
for about two weeks

1123
00:54:51,392 --> 00:54:52,600
when we're going to go deep--

1124
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:56,840
we're going to do a deep
dive on all of these.

1125
00:54:56,840 --> 00:55:00,820
But basically, Sean's point
is if a central bank issues

1126
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:03,700
currency directly to
the public digitally,

1127
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:07,610
could it also undermine
monetary policy?

1128
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:10,840
And there's a bunch of
neat trade-offs there.

1129
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:12,520
I leave it for you
just to say we're

1130
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:14,650
going to come back to that.

1131
00:55:14,650 --> 00:55:17,620
The investing public--
so we've talked

1132
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:21,710
about that the markets are
readily susceptible to fraud

1133
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:22,540
manipulation.

1134
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:24,740
And we're going to spend
a couple of lectures

1135
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:28,410
on crypto exchanges.

1136
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:33,310
But they're not regulated
for market integrity.

1137
00:55:33,310 --> 00:55:35,800
So a simple thing like--

1138
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,095
remind me your first name.

1139
00:55:37,095 --> 00:55:38,020
AUDIENCE: Michael.

1140
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:38,937
GARY GENSLER: Michael.

1141
00:55:38,937 --> 00:55:40,420
Michael has trades.

1142
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:43,000
And I'm assuming some of
those are on crypto exchanges?

1143
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:43,770
AUDIENCE: Yes.

1144
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:44,770
GARY GENSLER: All right.

1145
00:55:44,770 --> 00:55:48,010
So when Michael puts an
order on a crypto exchange,

1146
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:51,670
there's currently no
rules in the rule books,

1147
00:55:51,670 --> 00:55:55,270
no law in the law that
says that exchange

1148
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:56,980
can't front-run Michael.

1149
00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:01,840
So Michael says he wants
to buy Bitcoin at $6,400

1150
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:05,620
and the crypto exchange could
buy some in front of him

1151
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:07,680
at $6,490--

1152
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,790
or $6,390.

1153
00:56:09,790 --> 00:56:11,830
Yeah, sorry.

1154
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:13,790
That's called front running.

1155
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:17,260
So there are many,
many ways to make money

1156
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:22,440
on Michael's order that
can just be goofed around.

1157
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:24,630
Kyle, is that a question?

1158
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:28,020
AUDIENCE: I thought that
front-running [INAUDIBLE]

1159
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:30,480
were criminal activities
if they weren't

1160
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:35,740
covered in a particular
law or regulation by FINRA.

1161
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:37,410
Is that not correct?

1162
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:38,880
GARY GENSLER: So
Kyle is raising--

1163
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:42,780
well, maybe if it's not covered
by investor protection laws,

1164
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:45,120
might it be covered
by other laws?

1165
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,740
You mentioned FINRA.

1166
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:49,980
FINRA, which is the
self-regulatory organization

1167
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:53,460
in the US for investments,
would be investment law.

1168
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:54,910
But Kyle, you're right.

1169
00:56:54,910 --> 00:57:00,060
Certain things are still
against consumer laws.

1170
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:02,490
I don't think front-running
is one of them,

1171
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:05,630
but you might be
right about that.

1172
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,195
I would contend--

1173
00:57:07,195 --> 00:57:12,110
I'm an advocate that
Western societies early on

1174
00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:14,390
and many developing
countries in Asia,

1175
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:18,380
elsewhere benefited by
layering investor protection

1176
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:20,540
over consumer protection.

1177
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:24,770
That consumer protection is
about transacting and the fraud

1178
00:57:24,770 --> 00:57:27,530
that can happen in a
transaction-- selling

1179
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:30,080
an automobile,
selling a baby's crib,

1180
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:33,620
and so forth, selling
a bottle of milk.

1181
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:38,090
Investor protection also layers
on something else which has

1182
00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:41,690
to do with issuers having
information asymmetries,

1183
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:43,760
that the issuer
knows something--

1184
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,800
the person raising money--

1185
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:48,690
and the purchaser does
not know that information.

1186
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:51,740
There's a lot of
information asymmetries

1187
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:55,220
that you're trying to
address in the market.

1188
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:58,550
And then secondly
around exchanges

1189
00:57:58,550 --> 00:58:01,400
the concepts of
pre-trade transparency,

1190
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:05,420
post-trade transparency,
trying to bring transparency

1191
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:08,610
and saying we're going to
promote economic activity.

1192
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:11,600
So in the US, there were
two laws passed in 1933

1193
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:15,722
and '34, the Exchange Act and--

1194
00:58:15,722 --> 00:58:17,930
sorry, I'm going to have to
remember-- the Securities

1195
00:58:17,930 --> 00:58:18,972
Act and the Exchange Act.

1196
00:58:18,972 --> 00:58:21,470
But one was for issuers,
which was the first one,

1197
00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:25,490
and the second was for
exchanges in '33 and '34.

1198
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:28,140
And I think those
are the key things.

1199
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:30,050
Let me just mention--
the key question,

1200
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:31,850
the definition that
we will be wrestling

1201
00:58:31,850 --> 00:58:34,070
with for the next
several weeks is

1202
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:37,310
when is something is security,
when is it a commodity, when

1203
00:58:37,310 --> 00:58:39,080
is it a derivative.

1204
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:42,530
We don't have to answer these
today, but those will be--

1205
00:58:42,530 --> 00:58:43,890
is it a security?

1206
00:58:43,890 --> 00:58:45,050
Is it a commodity?

1207
00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:47,280
Is it a derivative?

1208
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,360
Not only are there
different laws for each,

1209
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:53,370
but there's different
public policies

1210
00:58:53,370 --> 00:58:57,240
and different normative
behavior that's implicated.

1211
00:58:57,240 --> 00:59:00,540
Securities are when
there is an issuer.

1212
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:03,150
And fundamentally, just from
a public policy point of view,

1213
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:06,210
there's an
information asymmetry.

1214
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:09,060
That person raising money
knows more information

1215
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:12,750
than the person investing,
they probably always will.

1216
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:17,085
So you get to, what's the
fair exchange of information?

1217
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,000
I'm going to skip
a couple of things

1218
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,660
just to say why investor
protection to Kyle's question.

1219
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:25,560
It goes beyond.

1220
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:29,790
And here are what are the Gary
Gensler four bullet points.

1221
00:59:29,790 --> 00:59:32,310
This you will not see
in a textbook somewhere.

1222
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:35,040
But these are the key things
I think investor protection

1223
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:37,490
layers on top of
consumer protection.

1224
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:40,710
One, investors get full
and fair disclosure.

1225
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:43,530
You can debate what full
and fair disclosure is,

1226
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:46,080
but it's something
more than I'm selling

1227
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:47,280
you this carton of milk.

1228
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:53,710
Fraud and deceptive
practices are prohibited.

1229
00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:55,660
Now, fraud is supposedly
prohibited even

1230
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:57,760
when you buy a carton
of milk, but there's

1231
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:00,010
some added bits to it.

1232
01:00:00,010 --> 01:00:02,770
And then this thing I said
about the secondary markets,

1233
01:00:02,770 --> 01:00:05,330
promoting price transparency.

1234
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:07,300
And then lastly one that
I hadn't talked about,

1235
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:10,750
that the advisors usually
have a lot of conflicts

1236
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:12,342
in the financial markets.

1237
01:00:12,342 --> 01:00:14,050
There's almost always,
in most countries,

1238
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:17,710
some additional responsibilities
around the advisors,

1239
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:20,350
whether it's what's called
a fiduciary responsibility

1240
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:22,450
or some other responsibility.

1241
01:00:22,450 --> 01:00:25,000
Sometimes, it's
just a best efforts,

1242
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,660
but there's usually some
additional responsibilities

1243
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:29,980
on advisors.

1244
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:31,930
And those four bullet points--

1245
01:00:31,930 --> 01:00:34,810
I don't mean to teach
a whole securities law

1246
01:00:34,810 --> 01:00:37,090
course in three minutes
or less, but those

1247
01:00:37,090 --> 01:00:38,560
are how I quite summarize it.

1248
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:39,060
Tom?

1249
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:40,560
AUDIENCE: That first
bullet, is that

1250
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:43,750
from insurers or from issuers?

1251
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:45,490
GARY GENSLER: Issuers.

1252
01:00:45,490 --> 01:00:46,630
Thank you.

1253
01:00:46,630 --> 01:00:49,240
Issuers, yes.

1254
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:49,857
Sorry.

1255
01:00:49,857 --> 01:00:50,357
Emily?

1256
01:00:50,357 --> 01:00:51,857
AUDIENCE: Is there
any consideration

1257
01:00:51,857 --> 01:00:57,340
for how to prioritize
between investor and consumer

1258
01:00:57,340 --> 01:01:00,310
protection versus,
say, tax enforcement?

1259
01:01:00,310 --> 01:01:04,020
In that I can imagine that if
there was increased protection,

1260
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:05,710
it would incentivize
more investment,

1261
01:01:05,710 --> 01:01:09,850
which then could, without
prior tax coverage,

1262
01:01:09,850 --> 01:01:11,310
make it so that [INAUDIBLE].

1263
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:13,407
GARY GENSLER: Is that
word tax or hacks?

1264
01:01:13,407 --> 01:01:13,990
AUDIENCE: Tax.

1265
01:01:13,990 --> 01:01:14,823
GARY GENSLER: T-A-X.

1266
01:01:14,823 --> 01:01:15,958
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

1267
01:01:15,958 --> 01:01:18,250
So I would imagine that more
protection would encourage

1268
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:20,560
more investment, but then
more people potentially

1269
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:24,100
would be evading taxes
if there wasn't already

1270
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:27,620
that tax framework in place.

1271
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:30,690
GARY GENSLER: So Emily
raises the question,

1272
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:32,550
how does any
society, in a sense,

1273
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:37,500
make some trade-offs between
tax and investor protection

1274
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:40,080
regimes?

1275
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:42,840
And ultimately, if I can
take it one step back,

1276
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,800
that's what some
countries are doing now,

1277
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:47,370
but they've been doing it
for a couple of centuries.

1278
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:49,260
How do you promote
innovation that might

1279
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:51,140
promote economic activity?

1280
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:53,730
So I'm broadening your question.

1281
01:01:53,730 --> 01:01:56,500
How do you promote
economic activity

1282
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:59,820
while in the midst still
promoting whatever social goods

1283
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:04,260
you're trying to achieve in
some regulatory framework?

1284
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:06,360
Investor protection,
so I made it

1285
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:10,290
the broadest, because that's
what you'll hear often

1286
01:02:10,290 --> 01:02:11,690
around blockchain and Bitcoin.

1287
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:13,920
But it was true when the
railroads came along.

1288
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:17,370
It was true more recently
when the internet came along,

1289
01:02:17,370 --> 01:02:19,170
how to promote
this new technology

1290
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:23,100
of the internet while actually
still promoting broadly

1291
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:26,420
the social goods that
we're trying to achieve.

1292
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:30,110
I'm one in the camp
that says protecting

1293
01:02:30,110 --> 01:02:32,870
against illicit activity,
financial stability

1294
01:02:32,870 --> 01:02:37,640
of investor protection
do, in and of themselves,

1295
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:41,060
promote society and
economic well-being.

1296
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:43,910
I don't think-- this
is Gary Gensler.

1297
01:02:43,910 --> 01:02:46,610
I don't think they're
necessarily in conflict.

1298
01:02:46,610 --> 01:02:49,430
There are others who
say no, no, no, no, you

1299
01:02:49,430 --> 01:02:52,850
can't promote economic
activity or taxes

1300
01:02:52,850 --> 01:02:57,040
and also promote
investor protection.

1301
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:59,150
I believe that's
more short sighted.

1302
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:02,650
I think the regimes and reforms
of the 1930s in this country

1303
01:03:02,650 --> 01:03:04,150
and other decades
in other countries

1304
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:08,590
are part of why we have had
such a prosperous last 70 or 80

1305
01:03:08,590 --> 01:03:09,850
years.

1306
01:03:09,850 --> 01:03:11,500
That investor
protection actually

1307
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:15,910
lowers the risk to issuers.

1308
01:03:15,910 --> 01:03:18,670
Thank you for
correcting, issuers.

1309
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:22,810
It lowers the risk of issuers
and lowers the cost of capital.

1310
01:03:22,810 --> 01:03:25,850
If you have good
investor protection,

1311
01:03:25,850 --> 01:03:32,220
I believe ultimately it
lowers the cost of capital,

1312
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:34,640
which is what I said and
those two bullet points.

1313
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,650
So US securities
law, did anybody

1314
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:38,510
want to tell me what
the Howey test was?

1315
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:44,610
What are those
arches right there?

1316
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:47,120
Well, we'll take somebody new.

1317
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:49,304
First name?

1318
01:03:49,304 --> 01:03:51,200
AUDIENCE: Actually,
the Howey Test

1319
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:57,810
is coming from a Supreme
Court case which was in 1946.

1320
01:03:57,810 --> 01:04:00,860
And at that time,
the Supreme Court

1321
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:04,520
was about to make a decision
on, as far as I remember,

1322
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:06,640
citrus groves.

1323
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:11,090
And at the end of the day,
they decided that citrus groves

1324
01:04:11,090 --> 01:04:12,800
are securities.

1325
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:17,800
And right after that,
there's a kind of agreement

1326
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:21,140
to be able to define
something as a security.

1327
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:23,790
It has to meet four criteria.

1328
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:25,290
GARY GENSLER: Let's
pause you there.

1329
01:04:25,290 --> 01:04:25,940
All right.

1330
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:28,730
So citrus groves
in Florida somehow

1331
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:30,410
are securities,
absolutely right.

1332
01:04:30,410 --> 01:04:33,890
A man named William Howey,
he ran for governor actually

1333
01:04:33,890 --> 01:04:35,610
in Florida a couple
of times and lost,

1334
01:04:35,610 --> 01:04:39,140
but he had a real estate
venture and he had those arches

1335
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:41,360
by his real estate venture.

1336
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:44,600
And he figured he could
sell part of his land

1337
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:46,310
as citrus groves.

1338
01:04:46,310 --> 01:04:49,370
So the question was, when he
was selling that land could that

1339
01:04:49,370 --> 01:04:53,510
be, actually technically
an investment contract?

1340
01:04:53,510 --> 01:04:57,140
Because in 1933, the
Congress of the United States

1341
01:04:57,140 --> 01:04:59,660
included in the
definition of security

1342
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:03,730
these two words,
investment contract.

1343
01:05:03,730 --> 01:05:06,850
It said equity, stock, options.

1344
01:05:06,850 --> 01:05:08,750
It kept having a
bunch of commas.

1345
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:11,630
There was a comma,
investment contract, comma,

1346
01:05:11,630 --> 01:05:12,830
and it kept going.

1347
01:05:12,830 --> 01:05:15,230
So the real legal question
that went to the Supreme Court

1348
01:05:15,230 --> 01:05:20,540
was not whether Bill Howey's
citrus groves were securities.

1349
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:24,920
It was whether Bill Howey's
citrus groves were investment

1350
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,930
contracts, because
Congress had already

1351
01:05:26,930 --> 01:05:30,890
decided by putting the two
words and a couple of columns

1352
01:05:30,890 --> 01:05:32,330
that it was a security.

1353
01:05:32,330 --> 01:05:34,760
And that separates us
from the European Union

1354
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:37,820
and many other jurisdictions,
because Congress

1355
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:41,240
put those two words in there,
investment contracts, which

1356
01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:43,250
had to do with a lot
of scams and frauds

1357
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:47,530
from the 1890s to the 1920s.

1358
01:05:47,530 --> 01:05:51,730
And to meet the
investment contract test

1359
01:05:51,730 --> 01:05:53,560
is this for part test.

1360
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:56,980
Is it an investment
of money or assets?

1361
01:05:56,980 --> 01:06:02,030
Basically, the SEC has said
that if you're giving Ether--

1362
01:06:02,030 --> 01:06:04,190
or you're giving
Bitcoin to buy Ether,

1363
01:06:04,190 --> 01:06:11,330
you're giving Bitcoin to buy
some Amanda token, all right?

1364
01:06:11,330 --> 01:06:13,580
That's an investment
of money or assets.

1365
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:14,900
That's what the SEC has said.

1366
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:17,810
And most lawyers kind
of agree with that.

1367
01:06:17,810 --> 01:06:20,810
Is it an investment in
a common enterprise?

1368
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:25,840
So is there a group
of developers that--

1369
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:28,230
or is this like a
common enterprise?

1370
01:06:28,230 --> 01:06:29,610
Some people debate that.

1371
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:31,650
Some people say, well,
we weren't-- really,

1372
01:06:31,650 --> 01:06:32,640
it's an open source.

1373
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,320
If you're an open
source software,

1374
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:36,030
that's not going to
be enough to get away

1375
01:06:36,030 --> 01:06:39,070
from being a common enterprise.

1376
01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:41,830
Is there a reasonable
expectation of profits?

1377
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:45,050
Most people think of profits
coming from dividends

1378
01:06:45,050 --> 01:06:49,540
or interest on your bond.

1379
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:52,840
The SEC has said, and
there's relevant court cases

1380
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:55,780
that say profits could
be just the expectation

1381
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:58,400
of the appreciation
of the asset.

1382
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:01,630
So I buy a token
today for six Ether

1383
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:05,180
and tomorrow I think it
might be worth 10 Eth.

1384
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:09,470
That's a reasonable
expectation of profits.

1385
01:07:09,470 --> 01:07:13,630
And the efforts of
others, is it reliant

1386
01:07:13,630 --> 01:07:14,630
on the efforts of other?

1387
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:17,160
This four part test.

1388
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:20,300
Jay Clayton, the head of the
SEC said earlier this year,

1389
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:22,730
in essence, he hadn't
met an ICO that he

1390
01:07:22,730 --> 01:07:24,650
didn't think was a security.

1391
01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:26,780
His words were a little
bit cleaner than that,

1392
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:30,710
but it was basically saying this
initial coin offering market is

1393
01:07:30,710 --> 01:07:32,330
probably mostly securities.

1394
01:07:32,330 --> 01:07:34,520
Again, it's probably
less than a quarter

1395
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:36,540
of the whole crypto
finance market.

1396
01:07:36,540 --> 01:07:39,020
It's a very relevant
issue if any of you

1397
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:41,540
are trying to do a startup.

1398
01:07:41,540 --> 01:07:46,070
But I would contend it's not
the largest public policy issue.

1399
01:07:46,070 --> 01:07:50,280
But borders and boundaries
make a difference.

1400
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:55,700
The Duck Test, this is
basically how I think about it.

1401
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:59,280
Christopher, you
want to say it again?

1402
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:01,790
AUDIENCE: If you see a bird
that walks like a duck,

1403
01:08:01,790 --> 01:08:04,340
swims like a duck, and
quacks like a duck,

1404
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:07,304
I think that's a damn duck.

1405
01:08:07,304 --> 01:08:10,730
GARY GENSLER: So if you have
a public policy question,

1406
01:08:10,730 --> 01:08:14,150
like, do I have to file
under the Bank Secrecy Act?

1407
01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:16,279
Do I have to be a security?

1408
01:08:16,279 --> 01:08:17,990
Do I have to be that?

1409
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:22,700
And before you pay that law
firm $1,000 or $1,500 an hour--

1410
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:26,450
and there are many lawyers
that, I guess, are worth that--

1411
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:29,359
ask yourself this question.

1412
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:33,569
And I'm trying to impart a value
judgment to all of you, too,

1413
01:08:33,569 --> 01:08:36,109
not only to save you
legal fees, but there

1414
01:08:36,109 --> 01:08:38,390
are many lawyers who
are going to try to help

1415
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:40,412
you solve your problems.

1416
01:08:40,412 --> 01:08:41,870
But when you feel
like they're just

1417
01:08:41,870 --> 01:08:44,660
trying to get between the
wallpaper and the wall

1418
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:47,420
with the narrowness and
the thinness of the slice

1419
01:08:47,420 --> 01:08:50,630
of their legal judgment,
remember how Christopher

1420
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:53,390
just gave us the Duck Test.

1421
01:08:53,390 --> 01:08:55,370
And then step away and
say, well, maybe there's

1422
01:08:55,370 --> 01:08:59,069
another business solution
to what you're trying to do,

1423
01:08:59,069 --> 01:09:01,250
because if it
doesn't pass the Duck

1424
01:09:01,250 --> 01:09:04,310
Test at some point in
time, you're probably

1425
01:09:04,310 --> 01:09:09,109
going to have your
friends from the IRS,

1426
01:09:09,109 --> 01:09:11,359
or your friends from
the Justice Department,

1427
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:15,200
or the friends from the
SEC knocking on your door.

1428
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:16,760
And those are the
friends you usually

1429
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:20,840
don't want to have
knocking on your door.

1430
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:24,529
There's still 200
to 300 ICOs a month.

1431
01:09:24,529 --> 01:09:28,870
I just wanted to say that
the market has not gone away.

1432
01:09:28,870 --> 01:09:30,819
And the Initial Coin
Offering Market,

1433
01:09:30,819 --> 01:09:33,399
which we're going to talk
about in a couple weeks,

1434
01:09:33,399 --> 01:09:36,830
has all these attributes
of the Howey Test.

1435
01:09:36,830 --> 01:09:39,729
They're raising proceeds
and they're usually

1436
01:09:39,729 --> 01:09:41,050
trying to be functional.

1437
01:09:41,050 --> 01:09:43,149
I want to skip ahead a
little bit to something

1438
01:09:43,149 --> 01:09:45,149
on public policy.

1439
01:09:45,149 --> 01:09:46,779
And we're going to
do crypto exchanges,

1440
01:09:46,779 --> 01:09:49,000
so I apologize I'm
running tight on time.

1441
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:55,030
But I want to do something
that Lauren and Tom have seen.

1442
01:09:55,030 --> 01:09:56,260
Well, let me pause here.

1443
01:09:56,260 --> 01:09:57,970
This is regulatory arbitrage.

1444
01:09:57,970 --> 01:10:00,160
And Kelly, given your
paper, you'll like this.

1445
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:03,535
But this is the list of where
cryptocurrency exchanges were.

1446
01:10:03,535 --> 01:10:05,350
It's from a Morgan
Stanley research

1447
01:10:05,350 --> 01:10:07,390
paper earlier this year.

1448
01:10:07,390 --> 01:10:09,610
But if you can see the
little slices on the left,

1449
01:10:09,610 --> 01:10:14,050
that's Malta, Belize,
and Seychelles,

1450
01:10:14,050 --> 01:10:16,870
three really deep
capital markets.

1451
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:19,300
Well, not really, not really.

1452
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:24,770
But a bunch of exchanges from
South Korea, Hong Kong and Asia

1453
01:10:24,770 --> 01:10:31,090
reincorporated in Malta,
the Seychelles, and Belize.

1454
01:10:31,090 --> 01:10:33,040
And so it's just
there is a whole bunch

1455
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:36,880
of regulatory arbitrage
going on right now.

1456
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:40,450
Public policy development--
this is only five minutes,

1457
01:10:40,450 --> 01:10:43,720
but I just wanted to mention
how public policy actually

1458
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:45,810
comes together.

1459
01:10:45,810 --> 01:10:49,960
And Tom, you going
to help me here?

1460
01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:51,730
You got it?

1461
01:10:51,730 --> 01:10:52,782
AUDIENCE: Analysis.

1462
01:10:52,782 --> 01:10:53,740
GARY GENSLER: Analysis.

1463
01:10:53,740 --> 01:10:55,120
Tom starts with analysis.

1464
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:57,670
Who thinks analysis
is at the top of what

1465
01:10:57,670 --> 01:10:59,810
happens in public policy?

1466
01:10:59,810 --> 01:11:02,130
Any show of hands?

1467
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:03,600
Tom, no.

1468
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:04,560
What's number one?

1469
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,850
What do you think happens first?

1470
01:11:06,850 --> 01:11:07,350
What's that?

1471
01:11:07,350 --> 01:11:08,310
AUDIENCE: Panic.

1472
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:10,980
GARY GENSLER: Panic.

1473
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:12,180
Public policy, huh?

1474
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:14,460
Panic?

1475
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:15,400
Lauren?

1476
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:16,817
AUDIENCE: I thought
this was going

1477
01:11:16,817 --> 01:11:18,660
to be a plug for your
personnel as policy.

1478
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:21,060
GARY GENSLER: Personnel as
policy is going to be in here,

1479
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:24,560
but messaging.

1480
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:27,130
If you don't get
your message right,

1481
01:11:27,130 --> 01:11:31,110
you're never going to
get to your analysis.

1482
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:35,006
But there's one other thing
between messaging and analysis.

1483
01:11:35,006 --> 01:11:36,320
AUDIENCE: Coalition.

1484
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:38,510
GARY GENSLER: Coalition
building or politics.

1485
01:11:38,510 --> 01:11:40,790
So messaging-- with
your messaging,

1486
01:11:40,790 --> 01:11:43,880
you can build a coalition,
which is called politics.

1487
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:45,860
And if you get your
politics right,

1488
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:49,400
you can actually get
to your analysis.

1489
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:52,730
This hierarchy, not
written in textbooks,

1490
01:11:52,730 --> 01:11:58,340
comes from an old, wonderful
political lawyer from Texas

1491
01:11:58,340 --> 01:12:00,057
who shared it with
me some 20 years ago

1492
01:12:00,057 --> 01:12:01,140
when I went to Washington.

1493
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:06,560
He said, young man, you know
nothing about this town.

1494
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:08,060
You don't get your
message right,

1495
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:09,620
you're not going to
get to your politics.

1496
01:12:09,620 --> 01:12:11,162
If you don't get
your politics right,

1497
01:12:11,162 --> 01:12:14,150
you'll never get to your
analysis and your policy.

1498
01:12:14,150 --> 01:12:18,130
And that's how it's
all made, kind of.

1499
01:12:18,130 --> 01:12:19,980
And so what do I
mean by messaging?

1500
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:21,920
So let's have a
little bit of fun.

1501
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,370
Does anybody remember this?

1502
01:12:24,370 --> 01:12:25,990
What's that?

1503
01:12:25,990 --> 01:12:27,250
What is that?

1504
01:12:27,250 --> 01:12:28,610
Messaging, right?

1505
01:12:28,610 --> 01:12:31,880
It's messaging from 2016.

1506
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:33,740
Does anybody want
to go back to 2008

1507
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:37,460
and tell me what was the message
for 2008 to have some fun?

1508
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:39,020
AUDIENCE: Hope and change.

1509
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:39,895
GARY GENSLER: Change.

1510
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:44,780
AUDIENCE: Change we believe in.

1511
01:12:44,780 --> 01:12:48,710
GARY GENSLER: You want
to go back to 2000?

1512
01:12:48,710 --> 01:12:49,850
Harder, harder I know.

1513
01:12:49,850 --> 01:12:52,910
It's almost-- it's not
in the history books yet.

1514
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:54,440
No?

1515
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:57,650
Compassionate conservative.

1516
01:12:57,650 --> 01:13:00,150
That's W. He was
compassionate, he

1517
01:13:00,150 --> 01:13:02,060
was conservative,
but compassionate,

1518
01:13:02,060 --> 01:13:05,860
a nod to that moderate side.

1519
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:06,860
'92?

1520
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:11,530
This is going to be hard, huh?

1521
01:13:11,530 --> 01:13:12,930
It's the economy, stupid.

1522
01:13:15,387 --> 01:13:16,720
That's Bill Clinton, by the way.

1523
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:21,130
It's the economy, stupid.

1524
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:22,780
So messaging.

1525
01:13:22,780 --> 01:13:24,910
Coalition building,
that just basically

1526
01:13:24,910 --> 01:13:27,500
means, unless you can
really bring folks together.

1527
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:30,190
So in the blockchain
Bitcoin space,

1528
01:13:30,190 --> 01:13:34,080
right now, there's
not a broad coalition.

1529
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:36,900
It's not a deep well of
people investing in blockchain

1530
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:38,770
and Bitcoin in America.

1531
01:13:38,770 --> 01:13:41,610
But if you were to try
to address yourselves

1532
01:13:41,610 --> 01:13:45,210
to legislative change
or regulatory change,

1533
01:13:45,210 --> 01:13:47,610
you'd need some coalition.

1534
01:13:47,610 --> 01:13:51,180
You probably can't just
be a bunch of miners,

1535
01:13:51,180 --> 01:13:56,070
or a bunch of incumbents, or
startups, or crypto exchanges.

1536
01:13:56,070 --> 01:13:59,220
There would have to be some
form of coalition building

1537
01:13:59,220 --> 01:14:02,710
that goes along with it.

1538
01:14:02,710 --> 01:14:04,690
Analysis does matter.

1539
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:06,940
I'm not going to say,
Tom, it doesn't matter.

1540
01:14:06,940 --> 01:14:13,160
It's just-- no, no, it's
just to get to the analysis--

1541
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:16,210
if you are sitting down with
somebody in Congress right now,

1542
01:14:16,210 --> 01:14:21,640
you probably also need,
as James says, the crisis.

1543
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:24,310
My sense is legislative
bodies around the globe,

1544
01:14:24,310 --> 01:14:27,070
by and large, are not engaged
in blockchain Bitcoin yet.

1545
01:14:27,070 --> 01:14:29,030
Gibraltar passed something.

1546
01:14:29,030 --> 01:14:30,370
Malta's passed something.

1547
01:14:30,370 --> 01:14:34,890
The Russian Duma,
thank you, has been

1548
01:14:34,890 --> 01:14:36,990
working on something
for six straight months

1549
01:14:36,990 --> 01:14:39,240
and can't come to a
coalition around it.

1550
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:41,310
Some state legislative
bodies in the US

1551
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:43,530
have passed some modest things.

1552
01:14:43,530 --> 01:14:45,840
There was a bill in
Arizona actually promoted

1553
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:49,950
to allow Bitcoin for
payment of taxes.

1554
01:14:49,950 --> 01:14:52,620
It failed in committee,
but it's interesting.

1555
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:53,590
Question?

1556
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:55,920
No.

1557
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:57,750
And yes, Lauren, you're right.

1558
01:14:57,750 --> 01:14:59,460
Personnel is policy.

1559
01:14:59,460 --> 01:15:03,960
Ultimately, who sits
in the jobs matters.

1560
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:05,400
And I would just close on it.

1561
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,650
Think of those several layers.

1562
01:15:07,650 --> 01:15:09,930
There's the political layer.

1563
01:15:09,930 --> 01:15:12,210
Those are either
elected or appointed

1564
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:13,650
by the people that are elected.

1565
01:15:13,650 --> 01:15:15,540
There's the political layer.

1566
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:17,910
And their risk
appetites are different

1567
01:15:17,910 --> 01:15:25,490
than the senior career level
and the day-to-day career level.

1568
01:15:25,490 --> 01:15:27,860
And the day-to-day
career level is usually

1569
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:31,220
that person with whom
we are all interfacing.

1570
01:15:31,220 --> 01:15:33,950
But as we all know, if you walk
into the Department of Motor

1571
01:15:33,950 --> 01:15:36,320
Vehicles, that
day-to-day person,

1572
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:40,220
that bureaucrat really
has a very narrow range

1573
01:15:40,220 --> 01:15:42,790
of decision making.

1574
01:15:42,790 --> 01:15:47,550
The senior career person
who's in their 40s or 50s has

1575
01:15:47,550 --> 01:15:53,730
a broader range of
decision making, but also

1576
01:15:53,730 --> 01:15:58,830
always remember they live in
a world of asymmetric risk.

1577
01:15:58,830 --> 01:16:01,830
There's not much
upside to saying yes

1578
01:16:01,830 --> 01:16:06,180
to something new, and funky,
and hard, and difficult,

1579
01:16:06,180 --> 01:16:09,450
but they could be getting
a host of downside risk

1580
01:16:09,450 --> 01:16:11,820
if it blows up on their watch.

1581
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:14,010
So there's asymmetric risk.

1582
01:16:14,010 --> 01:16:17,580
And Bitcoin and
blockchain gives that.

1583
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:20,220
So that's everything.

1584
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:24,180
Thursday is permissioned
versus permissionless systems.

1585
01:16:24,180 --> 01:16:26,310
So we'll dive into some of that.

1586
01:16:26,310 --> 01:16:30,570
If you've got more questions
on public policy, just ask.

1587
01:16:30,570 --> 01:16:33,240
We'll be talking about
the rest of the semester.

1588
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:37,770
And the conclusions, basically,
are public policy matters.

1589
01:16:37,770 --> 01:16:38,910
Thank you.

1590
01:16:38,910 --> 01:16:43,160
