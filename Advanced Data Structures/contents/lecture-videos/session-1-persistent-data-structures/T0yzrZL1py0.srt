00:00:21,056 --> 00:00:25,280
ERIK DEMAINE: Welcome to 6.851
Advanced Data Structures.

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,420
I am Erik Demaine.

10
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,170
You can call me Erik.

11
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,600
We have two TAs, Tom
Morgan and Justin Zhang.

12
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,900
Tom's back there.

13
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,260
Justin is late.

14
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,600
And this class is
about all kinds

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,567
of very cool data structures.

16
00:00:40,567 --> 00:00:42,650
You should have already
seen basic data structures

17
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:45,200
like balance binary
search trees and things

18
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,140
like that, log n
time to do wherever

19
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,060
you want in one dimension.

20
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,310
And here we're going to turn
all those data structures

21
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,143
on their head and
consider them in all sorts

22
00:00:54,143 --> 00:00:56,930
of different models and
additional cool problems.

23
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,630
Today we're going to talk about
time travel or temporal data

24
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:02,770
structures, where
you're manipulating time

25
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:05,510
as any good time
traveler should.

26
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,940
Then we'll do geometry where
we have higher dimensional

27
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,620
data, more than one dimension.

28
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,120
Then we'll look at
a problem called

29
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:14,900
dynamic optimality, which is,
is there one best binary search

30
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,642
tree that rules them all?

31
00:01:16,642 --> 00:01:19,100
Then we'll look at something
called memory hierarchy, which

32
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,580
is a way to model more realistic
computers which have cache

33
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,560
and then more cache
and then main memory

34
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,630
and then dish and all
these different levels.

35
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,580
How do you optimize for that?

36
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,770
Hashing is probably the most
famous, and most popular,

37
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,670
most used data structure
in computer science.

38
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,960
We'll do a little bit on that.

39
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,050
Integers, when you know that
your data is integers and not

40
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:42,147
just arbitrary black boxes that
you can compare or do whatever,

41
00:01:42,147 --> 00:01:43,730
you can do a lot
better with integers.

42
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:45,140
You usually beat log n time.

43
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,100
Often you can get constant time.

44
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,130
For example, if you want
to do priority queues,

45
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,800
you can do square
root log log n time.

46
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,100
That's the best
known randomized.

47
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,010
Dynamic graphs, you have
a graph you want to store,

48
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:01,440
and the edges are being added
and maybe deleted, like you're

49
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,690
representing a social network.

50
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,040
And people are friending
and de-friending.

51
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,081
You want to maintain some
interesting information

52
00:02:06,081 --> 00:02:07,760
about that graph.

53
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,669
Strings, you have
a piece of text,

54
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,555
such as the entire
worldwide web.

55
00:02:12,555 --> 00:02:14,180
And you want to search
for a substring.

56
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,540
How do you do that efficiently?

57
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,420
It's sort of the Google problem.

58
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,540
Or you searching through
DNA for patterns, whenever.

59
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,350
And finally succinct
data structures,

60
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,170
which is all about
taking what we normally

61
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:26,660
consider optimal
space or n space

62
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,440
and reducing it down to the very
bare minimum of bits of space.

63
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,745
Usually if you want
to store something

64
00:02:32,745 --> 00:02:34,370
where there's 2 to
the n possibilities,

65
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,620
you want to get away
with n bits of space,

66
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,030
maybe plus square root of
n or something very tiny.

67
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:42,740
So that's the sync
data structures.

68
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,790
So that's an overview
of the entire class.

69
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,970
And these are sort of the
sections we'll be following.

70
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,930
Let me give you a quick
administrative overview

71
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,350
of what we're doing.

72
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,520
Requirements for the class--

73
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,317
I guess, first,
attending lecture.

74
00:02:58,317 --> 00:02:59,900
Obviously if you
don't attend lecture,

75
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,983
there'll be videos online.

76
00:03:00,983 --> 00:03:02,810
So that's resolvable.

77
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:05,000
But let me know if you're
not going to make it.

78
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,410
We're going to have problems
sets roughly every week.

79
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,390
If you're taking the
class for credit,

80
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,500
they have a very simple rule
of one page in, one page out.

81
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,290
This is more constraint on
us to write problems that

82
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,719
have easy or short answers.

83
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:18,260
You probably need
to think about them

84
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,410
a little bit before they're
transparent, but then easy

85
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,060
to write up.

86
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,430
And then scribing lectures--
so we have a scribe for today,

87
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,580
I hope.

88
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,550
Here?

89
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,170
Yes, good.

90
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,210
So most of the
lectures have already

91
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,580
been scribed in some
version, and your goal

92
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:38,420
is to revise that scribe
notes that if you don't like

93
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:42,110
handwritten notes, which
are also online, then easier

94
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,320
for people to read.

95
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,160
Let's see.

96
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,187
Listeners welcome.

97
00:03:46,187 --> 00:03:48,020
We're going to have an
open problem session.

98
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,230
I really like open problems.

99
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,730
I really like solving
open problems.

100
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,540
So we've done this every time
this class has been offered.

101
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,790
So if you're interested in
also solving open problems,

102
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:56,910
it's optional.

103
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,480
I will organize-- in
a couple of weeks,

104
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,110
we'll have a weekly
open problem session

105
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,440
and try to solve
all the things that

106
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,080
push the frontier of
advanced data structures.

107
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,810
So in classes, we'll see
the state of the art.

108
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:15,671
And then we'll change the state
of the art in those sessions.

109
00:04:15,671 --> 00:04:16,420
I think that's it.

110
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,920
Any questions about
the class before we

111
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,089
get into the fun stuff?

112
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,900
All right.

113
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,142
Let's do some time traveling.

114
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:28,850
Before I get to time
traveling, though, I

115
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:32,420
need to define our
model of computation.

116
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,716
A theme in this class is that
the model of computation you're

117
00:04:35,716 --> 00:04:36,590
working with matters.

118
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,060
Models matter.

119
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,430
And there's lots of different
models of computation.

120
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:45,890
We'll see a few of the
main ones in this class.

121
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,580
And the starting
point, and the one

122
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:53,100
we'll be using throughout today,
is called a pointer machine.

123
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,485
It's an old one from the '80s.

124
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,240
And it corresponds to
what you might think about

125
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,090
if you've done a lot of
object-oriented programming,

126
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,950
and before that,
structure-oriented programming,

127
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:05,760
I guess.

128
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:08,660
So you have a bunch of nodes.

129
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:13,970
They have some fields in them,
a constant number of fields.

130
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,610
You can think of these
as objects or strucs

131
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:20,270
in c It used to be records
back in Pascal days,

132
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:22,170
so a lot of the papers
call them records.

133
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,170
You could just have a
constant number of fields.

134
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,300
You could think of
those numbered, labeled.

135
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,175
It doesn't really matter
because there's only

136
00:05:27,175 --> 00:05:28,550
a constant number of them.

137
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:32,240
Each of the fields could be
a pointer to another node,

138
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,550
could be a null pointer, or
could have some data in it.

139
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,760
So I'll just assume that
all my data is integers.

140
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:45,090
You can have a
pointer to yourself.

141
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:48,440
You can have a pointer over
here, whatever you want.

142
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,640
A pointer machine would
look something like this.

143
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,040
In any moment, this is the
state of the pointer machine.

144
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:59,300
So you think this as the memory
of your computer storing.

145
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,210
And then you have
some operations

146
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,660
that you're allowed to do.

147
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,800
That's the computation
part of the model.

148
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,570
You can think of this
as the memory model.

149
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:13,100
What you're allowed to
do are create nodes.

150
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,705
You can say something
like, x equals new node.

151
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:24,990
You can, I don't
know, look at fields.

152
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:28,070
You can do x equals y.field.

153
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:33,560
You can set fields,
x.field equals y.

154
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,400
You can compute on these
data, so you can add 5 and 7,

155
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,110
do things like that.

156
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,990
I'm not going to worry about--

157
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,700
I'll just write et cetera.

158
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,680
This is more a model
about how everything's

159
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,380
organized in memory, not so
much about what you're allowed

160
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,620
to do to the data items.

161
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,870
In this lecture, it
won't matter what

162
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,161
you're doing to the data items.

163
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,930
We never touch them.

164
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,840
We just copy them around.

165
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,870
So am I missing anything?

166
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:01,100
Probably.

167
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,950
I guess you could destroy
nodes if you felt like it.

168
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:06,566
But we won't have
to today, because we

169
00:07:06,566 --> 00:07:07,940
don't want to
throw anything away

170
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,200
when you're time traveling.

171
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,100
It's too dangerous.

172
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:18,570
And then the one catch
here is, what are x and y?

173
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:21,280
There's going to be one
node in this data structure

174
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,184
or in your memory
called the root node.

175
00:07:24,184 --> 00:07:26,600
And you could think of that
as that's the thing you always

176
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,800
have in your head.

177
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,390
This is like your
cache, if you will.

178
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,348
It's just got a constant
number of things, just

179
00:07:31,348 --> 00:07:32,470
like any other node.

180
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:37,490
And x and y are
fields of the root.

181
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,530
So that sort of
ties things down.

182
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,200
You're always working
relative to the root.

183
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:50,030
But you can look at the data,
basically follow this pointer,

184
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:53,040
by looking at the field.

185
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,850
You could set one
of these pointers--

186
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,160
I think I probably need
another operation here,

187
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,936
like x equals y.field1,
field2, that sort of thing,

188
00:08:03,936 --> 00:08:06,800
and maybe the reverse.

189
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,200
But you can manipulate
all nodes sort

190
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,770
of via the root is the idea.

191
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,710
You follow pointers,
do whatever.

192
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,780
So pretty obvious,
slightly annoying

193
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,250
to write down formally.

194
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,710
But that is pointer machine.

195
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,320
And what we're going to
be talking about today

196
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,829
in time travel is
suppose someone

197
00:08:28,829 --> 00:08:31,120
gives me a pointer machine
data structure, for example,

198
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,510
balanced binary search
tree, linked list.

199
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:36,030
A lot of data structures,
especially classic data

200
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:39,192
structures, follow
pointer machine model.

201
00:08:39,192 --> 00:08:41,400
What we'd like to do is
transform that data structure

202
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,816
or make a new
pointer machine data

203
00:08:42,816 --> 00:08:45,120
structure that does
extra cool things,

204
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,470
namely travel through time.

205
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:53,340
So that's what
we're going to do.

206
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:57,870
There's two senses of time
travel or temporal data

207
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:02,200
structures that we're going
to cover in this class.

208
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,400
The one for today is
called persistence,

209
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,310
where you don't forget
anything, like an elephant.

210
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:11,471
And the other one
is retroactivity.

211
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,800
Persistence will be today.

212
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,260
Retroactivity is next class.

213
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,670
Basically, these correspond
to two models of time travel.

214
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,176
Persistence is the branching
universe time travel model,

215
00:09:24,176 --> 00:09:25,800
where if you make a
change in the past,

216
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,350
you get a new universe.

217
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,460
You never destroy old universes.

218
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:33,255
Retroactivity is more
like Back to the Future,

219
00:09:33,255 --> 00:09:35,130
when you go back, make
a change, and then you

220
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,920
can return to the present
and see what happened.

221
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,710
This is a lot harder to do.

222
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:42,150
And we'll work on
that next class.

223
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:46,360
Persistence is what
we will do today.

224
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,670
So persistence.

225
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:01,810
The general idea of persistence
is to remember everything--

226
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:05,110
the general goal, I would say.

227
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:07,360
And by everything, I
mean different versions

228
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,800
of the data structure.

229
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,290
So you're doing data
structures in general.

230
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:14,550
We have update operations
and query operations.

231
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,387
We're mainly concerned
about updates here.

232
00:10:16,387 --> 00:10:18,220
Every time you do an
update, you think of it

233
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,730
as taking a version of the data
structure and making a new one.

234
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,800
And you never want to
destroy old versions.

235
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,230
So even though an update
like an insert or something

236
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:29,230
changes the data structure, we
want to remember that past data

237
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,770
as well.

238
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:34,030
And then let's make
this reasonable.

239
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:37,791
All data structure operations
are relative to a specified

240
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:38,290
version.

241
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:57,210
So an update makes and
returns a new version.

242
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:08,750
So when you do an
insert, you specify

243
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,850
a version of your data
structure and the thing

244
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:11,960
you want to insert.

245
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,850
And the output is a new version.

246
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:16,550
So then you could insert into
that new version, keep going,

247
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:20,210
or maybe go back to the
old version, modify that.

248
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:22,450
I haven't said exactly
what's allowed here,

249
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:25,460
but this is sort of
the general goal.

250
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:30,950
And then there are four
levels of persistence

251
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,020
that you might want to get.

252
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:37,440
First level is called
partial persistence.

253
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,690
This is the easiest to obtain.

254
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,630
And in partial
persistence, you're

255
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:55,460
only allowed to update
the latest version, which

256
00:11:55,460 --> 00:12:01,670
means the versions
are linearly ordered.

257
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,770
This is the easiest
to think about.

258
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:09,300
And time travel can easily get
confusing, so start simple.

259
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:14,780
We have a timeline of
various versions on it.

260
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:17,420
This is the latest.

261
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,850
And what we can do is
update that version.

262
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:23,750
We'll get a new version, and
then our latest is this one.

263
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:27,950
What this allows is looking back
at the past to an old version

264
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,282
and querying that version.

265
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:31,490
So you can still ask questions
about the old version,

266
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,830
if you want to be able to do
a search on any of these data

267
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:34,329
structures.

268
00:12:34,329 --> 00:12:35,600
But you can't change them.

269
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,180
You can only change the
most recent version.

270
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,470
So that's nice.

271
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:44,690
It's kind of like time
machine on Mac, I guess.

272
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:46,970
If you've ever seen the
movie Deja Vu, which is not

273
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,636
very common, but it's
a good time travel

274
00:12:48,636 --> 00:12:51,500
movie, in the first half of
the movie, all they can do

275
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,550
is look back at the past.

276
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,710
Later they discover
that actually they

277
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,850
have a full persistence model.

278
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,930
It takes a while
for dramatic effect.

279
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:08,750
In full persistence, you can
update anything you want--

280
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,015
so update any version.

281
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:24,200
and so then the
versions form a tree.

282
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:28,460
OK.

283
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,200
So in this model,
maybe you initially

284
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,420
have a nice line of versions.

285
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,860
But now if I go back to
this version and update it,

286
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,340
I branch, get a
new version here.

287
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,400
And then I might keep modifying
that version sometimes.

288
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,660
Any of these guys can branch.

289
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,480
So this is why I call it the
branching universe model, when

290
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,685
you update your branch.

291
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,380
So no version ever
gets destroyed here.

292
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,720
Again, you can
query all versions.

293
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,360
But now you can also
update any version.

294
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,710
But you just make a new version.

295
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,660
It's a totally new world.

296
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,490
When I update this
version, this version

297
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,410
knows nothing about all the--

298
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,940
this doesn't know
about this future.

299
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,890
It's created its own future.

300
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:14,310
There's no way to sort of
merge those universes together.

301
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,910
It's kind of sad.

302
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:22,220
That's why we have the
third level of persistence,

303
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,680
which lets us merge timelines.

304
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,940
It's great for lots
of fiction out there.

305
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,360
If you've seen the
old TV show Sliders,

306
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,660
that would be
confluent persistence.

307
00:14:50,830 --> 00:15:01,790
So confluent persistence,
you can combine two versions

308
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,110
to create a new version.

309
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:13,720
And in this case, again, you
can't destroy old versions.

310
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,260
In persistence, you
never destroy versions.

311
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:22,520
So now the versions form a
DAG, directed acyclic graph.

312
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,010
So now we're allowing--

313
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,520
OK, you make some
changes, whatever.

314
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:30,274
You branch your universe,
make some changes.

315
00:15:30,274 --> 00:15:32,440
And now I can say, OK, take
this version of the data

316
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:35,510
structure and this version
and recombine them.

317
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:38,730
Get a new version, and then
maybe make some more changes.

318
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,654
OK, what does combine mean?

319
00:15:40,654 --> 00:15:42,320
Well, it depends on
your data structure.

320
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,420
A lot of data structures
have combine operations

321
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:48,029
like if you have linked lists,
you have two linked lists,

322
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:49,070
you can concatenate them.

323
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,180
That's an easy operation.

324
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,721
Even if you have
binary search trees,

325
00:15:51,721 --> 00:15:53,750
you can concatenate
them reasonably easy

326
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,670
and combine it into one
big binary search tree.

327
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,060
So if your data structure
has an operation that

328
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,850
takes as input two
data structures,

329
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:05,150
then what we're saying is now
it can take two versions, which

330
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,430
is more general.

331
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,240
So I could take the
same data structure,

332
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,430
make some changes in
one way, separately make

333
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:12,138
some changes in a
different way, and then

334
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,660
try to concatenate them
or do something crazy.

335
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,550
This is hard to
do, and most of it

336
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:19,090
is an open problem
whether it can be done.

337
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:21,590
But I'll tell you about it.

338
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:24,860
Then there's another level
even more than confluent

339
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,550
persistence.

340
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:30,590
This is hard to interpret
in the time travel world,

341
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,430
but it would be functional
data structures.

342
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:34,130
If you've ever programmed
in a functional programming

343
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:36,800
language, it's a little bit
annoying from an algorithm's

344
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,650
perspective, because it
constrains you to work

345
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:43,220
in a purely functional world.

346
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,900
You can never modify anything.

347
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,400
OK.

348
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,220
Now, we don't want
to modify versions.

349
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:49,830
That's fine.

350
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,288
But in a functional
data structure,

351
00:16:51,288 --> 00:16:54,110
you're not allowed to
modify any nodes ever.

352
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,720
All you can do is
make new notes.

353
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:07,317
This is constraining,
and you can't always

354
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,400
get optimal running times
in the functional world.

355
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,358
But if you can get a
functional data structure,

356
00:17:11,358 --> 00:17:13,300
you have all these
things, because you

357
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,259
can't destroy anything.

358
00:17:14,259 --> 00:17:16,216
If you can't destroy
nodes, then in particular,

359
00:17:16,216 --> 00:17:17,430
you can't destroy versions.

360
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,930
And all of these things
just work for free.

361
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:22,957
And so a bunch of
special cases are known,

362
00:17:22,957 --> 00:17:24,790
interesting special
cases, like search trees

363
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:26,470
you can do in the
functional world.

364
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,050
And that makes all
of these things easy.

365
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,790
So the rest of this
lecture is going

366
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:34,270
to be general techniques for
doing partial full persistence,

367
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,250
what we know about
confluent, and what

368
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:41,060
we know about functional,
brief overview.

369
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,680
Any questions about those
goals, problem definitions?

370
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,191
Yeah.

371
00:17:48,191 --> 00:17:50,834
AUDIENCE: I'm still confused
about functional, because--

372
00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:52,500
ERIK DEMAINE: What
does functional mean?

373
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,260
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

374
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,680
ERIK DEMAINE: Yeah, I
guess you'll see what--

375
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,200
functional looks like all
the other things, I agree.

376
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,360
You'll see in a moment
how we actually implement

377
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,380
partial and persistence.

378
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:07,490
We're going to be
changing nodes a lot.

379
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:10,670
As long as we still
represent the same data

380
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:13,040
in the old versions, we
don't have to represent it

381
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,164
in the same way.

382
00:18:14,164 --> 00:18:15,830
That lets us do things
more efficiently.

383
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,720
Whereas in functional,
you have to represent

384
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,430
all the old versions
in exactly the way

385
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,794
you used to represent them.

386
00:18:20,794 --> 00:18:22,460
Here we can kind of
mangle things around

387
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,585
and it makes things faster.

388
00:18:23,585 --> 00:18:25,490
Yeah, good question.

389
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:29,882
So it seems almost the same,
but it's nodes versus versions.

390
00:18:29,882 --> 00:18:31,340
I haven't really
defined a version.

391
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:34,580
But it's just that all the
queries answer the same way.

392
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,580
That's what you need
for persistence.

393
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,780
Other questions?

394
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,620
All right.

395
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,811
Well, let's do some
real data structures.

396
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,310
We start with
partial persistence.

397
00:18:55,907 --> 00:18:56,740
This is the easiest.

398
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,080
For both partial and
full persistence,

399
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,400
there is the following result.
Any pointer machine data

400
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:19,660
structure, one catch with a
constant number of pointers

401
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,220
to any node--

402
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,310
so this is constant n degree.

403
00:19:27,726 --> 00:19:30,017
In a pointer machine, you
always have a constant number

404
00:19:30,017 --> 00:19:32,540
of pointers out
of a node at most.

405
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,540
But for this result
to hold, we also

406
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,280
need a constant number of
pointers into any node.

407
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,806
So this is an extra constraint.

408
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:47,320
Can be transformed into
another data structure that

409
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:53,770
is partially persistent and does
all the things it used to do--

410
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:56,362
so I'll just say, can be
made partially persistent.

411
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,550
You have to pay something, but
you have to pay very little--

412
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:12,550
constant amortized
factor overhead,

413
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:21,860
multiplicative overhead
and constant amount

414
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:30,290
of additive space per change
in the data structure.

415
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:33,660
So every time you do a
modification in your pointer

416
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,260
machine-- you set one of
the fields to something--

417
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,830
you have to store that forever.

418
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:39,980
So, I mean, this is the
best you could hope to do.

419
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:43,250
You've got to store
everything that happened.

420
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,760
You pay a constant
factor overhead, eh.

421
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,670
We're theoreticians.

422
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:48,170
That doesn't matter.

423
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:50,840
Then you get any data
structure in this world

424
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,270
can be made
partially persistent.

425
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,026
That's nice.

426
00:20:54,026 --> 00:20:54,650
Let's prove it.

427
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:02,140
OK, the idea is pretty simple.

428
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,790
Pointer machines are all
about nodes and fields.

429
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:09,820
So we just need to simulate
whatever the data structure is

430
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,710
doing to those nodes
and fields in a way

431
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,540
that we don't lose
all the information

432
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:17,320
and we can still
search it very quickly.

433
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:21,190
First idea is to
store back pointers.

434
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:24,872
And this is why we need the
constant n degree constraint.

435
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:31,075
So if we have a node--

436
00:21:31,075 --> 00:21:32,610
how do I want to
draw a node here?

437
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,700
So maybe these are the
three fields of the node.

438
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,930
I want to also store
some back pointers.

439
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:48,480
Whenever there is a node
that points to this node,

440
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,670
I want to have a
back pointer that

441
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:54,210
points back so I know where
all the pointers came from.

442
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:57,600
If there's only p pointers,
then this is fine.

443
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,960
There'll be p fields here.

444
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,879
So still constant, still in
the pointier machine model.

445
00:22:03,879 --> 00:22:05,670
OK, I'm going to need
some other stuff too.

446
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:11,310
So this is a simple thing,
definitely want this.

447
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,470
Because if my nodes
ever move around,

448
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,172
I've got to update
the pointers to them.

449
00:22:15,172 --> 00:22:16,380
And where are those pointers?

450
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:20,030
Well, the back pointers
tell you where they are.

451
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:22,410
Nodes will still
be constant size,

452
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:25,500
remain in pointer
machine data structure.

453
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,340
OK.

454
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,230
That's idea one.

455
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:35,080
Idea two is this part.

456
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:39,485
This is going to store
something called mods.

457
00:22:39,485 --> 00:22:44,020
It could stand for something,
but I'll leave it as mods.

458
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:56,530
So these are two of the
fields of the data structure.

459
00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:01,480
Ah, one convenience here
is for back pointers,

460
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,840
I'm only going to store it for
the latest version of the data

461
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,780
structure.

462
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:16,810
Sorry.

463
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:19,610
I forgot about that.

464
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:21,397
We'll come back to that later.

465
00:23:21,397 --> 00:23:23,480
And then the idea is to
store these modifications.

466
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,730
How many modifications?

467
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:29,610
Let's say up to p, twice p.

468
00:23:34,835 --> 00:23:38,640
p was the bound on the
n degree of a node.

469
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,870
So I'm going to allow 2p
modifications over here.

470
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:45,450
And what's a
modification look like?

471
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,770
It's going to consist
of three things--

472
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:53,700
get them in the right order--

473
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,850
the version in which
something was changed,

474
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:02,830
the field that got changed,
and the value it go changed to.

475
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:07,920
So the idea is that these
are the fields here.

476
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,870
We're not going to touch those.

477
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:11,784
Once they're set to something--

478
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,450
or, I mean, whatever
they are initially,

479
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:15,370
they will stay that way.

480
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,420
And so instead of actually
changing things like the data

481
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,920
structure normally
would, we're just

482
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,810
going to add modifications
here to say, oh,

483
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:25,410
well at this time, this field
changed to the value of 5.

484
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,720
And then later on, it
changed to the value 7.

485
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,380
And then later on, this one
changed to the value 23,

486
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,320
whatever.

487
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,292
So that's what
they'll look like.

488
00:24:36,292 --> 00:24:37,500
There's a limit to how many--

489
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,920
we can only store a constant
number of mods to each node.

490
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,580
And our constant will be 2p.

491
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,080
OK.

492
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,220
Those are the
ideas, and now it's

493
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,761
just a matter of
making this all work

494
00:24:47,761 --> 00:24:50,510
and analyzing that it's
constant amortized overhead.

495
00:24:53,260 --> 00:25:06,230
So first thing is if you
want to read a field,

496
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,090
how would I read a field?

497
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:09,020
This is really easy.

498
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:15,920
First you look at what the
field is in the node itself.

499
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,831
But then it might
have been changed.

500
00:25:17,831 --> 00:25:19,580
And so remember when
I say read the field,

501
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,600
I actually mean while
I'm given some version,

502
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,655
v, I want to know what is the
value of this field at version

503
00:25:24,655 --> 00:25:28,280
v, because I want to be able
to look at any of the old data

504
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,630
structures too.

505
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:37,370
So this would be at
version v. I just

506
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,840
look through all
the modifications.

507
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,923
There's constantly many,
so it takes constant time

508
00:25:40,923 --> 00:25:43,730
to just flip through them
and say, well, what changes

509
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:46,160
have happened up to version v?

510
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:56,750
So I look at mods
with version less than

511
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,450
or equal to v. That will be all
the changes that happened up

512
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:00,770
to this point.

513
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,060
I see, did this field change?

514
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,710
I look at the latest one.

515
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:07,250
That will be how I read
the field of the node, so

516
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,517
constant time.

517
00:26:08,517 --> 00:26:10,850
There's lots of ways to make
this efficient in practice.

518
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:13,730
But for our purposes,
it doesn't matter.

519
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:16,010
It's constant.

520
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:18,890
The hard part is how
do you change a field?

521
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:22,427
Because there might not be
any room in the mod structure.

522
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:44,525
So to modify, say we want to
set node.field equal to x.

523
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:52,740
What we do is first
we check, is there

524
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,270
any space in the mod structure?

525
00:26:54,270 --> 00:27:03,080
If there's any blank mods,
so if the node is not full,

526
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,630
we just add a mod.

527
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:13,106
So a mod will look
like now field x.

528
00:27:13,106 --> 00:27:15,810
Just throw that in there.

529
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:17,650
Because right at this moment--

530
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:19,560
so we maintain a time
counter, just increment

531
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,930
it ever time we do a change.

532
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,320
This field changed that value.

533
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,540
So that's the easy case.

534
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:29,340
The trouble, of course,
is if the node is full--

535
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,067
the moment you've
all been waiting for.

536
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:33,150
So what we're going to do
here is make a new node.

537
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,690
We've ran out of space.

538
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:36,064
So we need to make a new node.

539
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:38,730
We're not going to touch the old
node, just going to let it sit.

540
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:40,530
It still maintains all
those old versions.

541
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:43,230
Now we want a new node
that represents the latest

542
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,970
and greatest of this node.

543
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:45,490
OK.

544
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:47,700
So make a new node.

545
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:57,060
I'll call it node prime to
distinguish from node, where

546
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:04,705
with all the mods, and this
modification in particular,

547
00:28:04,705 --> 00:28:05,205
applied.

548
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:11,160
OK, so we make a new
version of this node.

549
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:15,370
It's going to have some
different fields, whatever

550
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:18,730
was the latest version
represented by those mods.

551
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:20,525
It's still going to
have back pointers,

552
00:28:20,525 --> 00:28:24,810
so we have to maintain
all those back pointers.

553
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:26,400
And now the mod,
initially, is going

554
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,340
to be empty, because we
just applied them all.

555
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:32,460
So this new node doesn't
have any recent mods.

556
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,320
Old node represents
the old versions.

557
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,935
This node is going to
represent the new versions.

558
00:28:37,935 --> 00:28:39,420
What's wrong with this picture?

559
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,770
AUDIENCE: Update pointers.

560
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:42,120
ERIK DEMAINE: Update pointers.

561
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,890
Yeah, there's pointers
to the old version

562
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:47,580
of the node, which are fine for
the old versions of the data

563
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,259
structure.

564
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:50,300
But for the latest version
of the data structure,

565
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,560
this node has moved
to this new location.

566
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,070
So if there are any old
pointers to that node,

567
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:58,440
we've got to update them
in the current version.

568
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,648
We have to update them to
point to this node instead.

569
00:29:00,648 --> 00:29:04,060
The old versions are fine, but
the new version is in trouble.

570
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,120
Other questions or
all the same answer?

571
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:06,791
Yeah.

572
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:10,719
AUDIENCE: So if you wanted
to read an old version

573
00:29:10,719 --> 00:29:15,630
but you just have the
new version, [INAUDIBLE]?

574
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:16,555
ERIK DEMAINE: OK--

575
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:17,430
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

576
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,180
ERIK DEMAINE: The
question is essentially,

577
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:22,059
how do we hold on to versions?

578
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:24,600
Essentially, you can think of
a version of the data structure

579
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,404
as where the root node is.

580
00:29:26,404 --> 00:29:27,570
That's probably the easiest.

581
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:29,528
I mean, in general, we're
representing versions

582
00:29:29,528 --> 00:29:33,120
by a number, v. But we
always start at the root.

583
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,077
And so you've given
the data structure,

584
00:29:35,077 --> 00:29:36,660
which is represented
by the root node.

585
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:40,020
And you say, search
for the value 5.

586
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:43,289
Is it in this binary
search tree or whatever?

587
00:29:43,289 --> 00:29:45,330
And then you just start
navigating from the root,

588
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:49,560
but you know I'm inversion
a million or whatever.

589
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,340
I know what version
I'm looking for.

590
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:56,040
So you start with the root,
which never changes, let's say.

591
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,320
And then you follow
pointers that

592
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,060
essentially tell
you for that version

593
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,380
where you should be going.

594
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,780
I guess at the root version,
it's a little trickier.

595
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:07,710
You probably want a little array
that says for this version,

596
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:08,900
here's the root node.

597
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,130
But that's a special case.

598
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:11,670
Yeah.

599
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:13,234
Another question?

600
00:30:13,234 --> 00:30:15,222
AUDIENCE: So on the
new node that you

601
00:30:15,222 --> 00:30:19,606
created, the fields that you
copied, you also have to have

602
00:30:19,606 --> 00:30:20,689
a version for them, right?

603
00:30:20,689 --> 00:30:22,180
Because [INAUDIBLE]?

604
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:27,731
ERIK DEMAINE: These--

605
00:30:27,731 --> 00:30:30,190
AUDIENCE: Or do you
version the whole node?

606
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:32,650
ERIK DEMAINE: Here we're
versioning the whole node.

607
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:34,600
The original field
values represent

608
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,940
what was originally there,
whenever this node was created.

609
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:40,250
Then the mods specify what
time the fields change.

610
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:44,200
So I don't think
we need times here.

611
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,326
All right.

612
00:30:45,326 --> 00:30:47,200
So we've got to update
two kinds of pointers.

613
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,810
There's regular
pointers, which live

614
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:52,140
in the fields, which are
things pointing to the node.

615
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,640
But then there's
also back pointers.

616
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,909
Because if this is
a pointer to a node,

617
00:30:55,909 --> 00:30:57,950
then there'll be a back
pointer back to the node.

618
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:00,620
And all of those have to change.

619
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:03,765
Conveniently, the back
pointers are easy.

620
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,535
So if they're back
pointers to the node,

621
00:31:13,535 --> 00:31:14,910
we change them to
the node prime.

622
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,080
How do we find
the back pointers?

623
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,621
Well, we just follow
all the pointers

624
00:31:17,621 --> 00:31:21,330
and then there will be
back pointers there.

625
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:23,040
Because I said we're
only maintaining

626
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,650
backed pointers for
the latest version,

627
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:28,299
I don't need to preserve
the old versions

628
00:31:28,299 --> 00:31:29,340
of those backed pointers.

629
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:31,025
So I just go in
and I change them.

630
00:31:31,025 --> 00:31:33,150
It takes constant time,
because the constant number

631
00:31:33,150 --> 00:31:35,700
of things I point to, each
one as a back pointer.

632
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,130
So this is cheap.

633
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:39,210
There's no persistence here.

634
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:41,940
That's an advantage of
partial persistence.

635
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,370
The hard part is
updating the pointers

636
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:45,684
because those live in fields.

637
00:31:45,684 --> 00:31:47,850
I need to remember the old
versions of those fields.

638
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:49,564
And that we do recursively.

639
00:31:58,746 --> 00:32:00,120
Because to change
those pointers,

640
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,170
that's a field update.

641
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,940
That's something
exactly of this form.

642
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:05,970
So that's the same operation
but on a different node.

643
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:07,440
So I just do that.

644
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,760
I claim this is good.

645
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,400
That's the end of the algorithm.

646
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,540
Now we need to analyze it.

647
00:32:24,886 --> 00:32:25,760
How do we analyze it?

648
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,260
Any guesses?

649
00:32:29,498 --> 00:32:30,500
AUDIENCE: Amortize it.

650
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,208
ERIK DEMAINE: Amortized
analysis, exactly

651
00:32:32,208 --> 00:32:33,620
the answer I was looking for.

652
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,580
OK.

653
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,290
[INAUDIBLE] amortization.

654
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:38,330
The most powerful
technique in amortization

655
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:40,460
is probably the
potential method.

656
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,370
So we're going to use that.

657
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:44,360
There's a sort of more--

658
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:47,990
you'll see a charging
argument in a moment.

659
00:32:50,914 --> 00:32:53,330
We want the potential function
to represent when this data

660
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:55,300
structure is in a bad state.

661
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:58,807
Intuitively, it's in a bad state
when a lot of nodes are full.

662
00:32:58,807 --> 00:33:00,890
Because then as soon as
you make a change in them,

663
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:03,680
they will burst, and you have
to do all this crazy recursion

664
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,580
and stuff.

665
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,990
This case is nice and cheap.

666
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:08,680
We just add a modification,
constant time.

667
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,430
This case, not so nice
because we recurse.

668
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:12,740
And then that's going
to cause more recursions

669
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:16,040
and all sorts of
chaos could happen.

670
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:20,030
So there's probably a few
different potential functions

671
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,080
that would work here.

672
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,150
And an old version
of these nodes I said

673
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:25,070
should be the number
of full nodes.

674
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,680
But I think we can make
life a little bit easier

675
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:32,390
by the following.

676
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:36,674
Basically, the total
number of modifications--

677
00:33:36,674 --> 00:33:39,800
not quite the total,
almost the total.

678
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:49,760
So I'm going to do c times
the sum of the number of mods

679
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:56,190
in latest version nodes.

680
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,530
OK.

681
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:02,984
So because we sort
of really only

682
00:34:02,984 --> 00:34:05,150
care about-- we're only
changing the latest version,

683
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:07,070
so I really only
care about nodes that

684
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,570
live in the latest version.

685
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:09,659
What do I mean by this?

686
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:11,909
Well, when I made
this new node prime,

687
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:14,000
this becomes the new
representation of that node.

688
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,690
The old version is dead.

689
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:18,560
We will never change it again.

690
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,080
If we're modifying, we will
never even look at it again.

691
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:24,805
Because now everything
points to here.

692
00:34:24,805 --> 00:34:26,429
So I don't really
care about that node.

693
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:27,690
It's got a ton of mods.

694
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:30,380
But what's nice is that when
I create this new node, now

695
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,882
the mod list is empty.

696
00:34:31,882 --> 00:34:33,840
So I start from scratch,
just like reinstalling

697
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,870
your operating system.

698
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:38,010
It's a good feeling.

699
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:45,090
And so the potential goes down
by, I guess, c times 2 times p.

700
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:49,764
When I do this change, potential
goes down by basically p.

701
00:34:49,764 --> 00:34:52,230
AUDIENCE: Is c any constant or--

702
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:55,440
ERIK DEMAINE: c will be a
constant to be determined.

703
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,180
I mean, it could be 1.

704
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,770
It depends how you
want to define it.

705
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:02,130
I'm going to use the CLRS
notion of amortized cost, which

706
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:06,777
is actual cost plus
change in potential.

707
00:35:06,777 --> 00:35:08,610
And then I need a
constant here, because I'm

708
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:12,850
measuring a running time versus
some combinatorial quantity.

709
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:17,410
So this will be to match the
running time that we'll get to.

710
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:17,990
OK.

711
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:22,290
So what is amortized cost?

712
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:24,920
There's sort of two
cases modification.

713
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,440
There's the cheap case
and the not so cheap case.

714
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,945
In general, amortized cost--

715
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,920
in both cases, it's
going to be at most--

716
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,810
well, first of all, we
do some constant work

717
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:44,640
just to figure out all this
stuff, make copies, whatever.

718
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,680
So that's some constant time.

719
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,920
That's the part that I don't
want to try to measure.

720
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,140
Then potentially,
we add a new mod.

721
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:59,430
If we add a mod, that
increases the potential by c.

722
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:02,070
Because we're just counting
mods, multiplying by c.

723
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:04,702
So we might get plus 1 mod.

724
00:36:04,702 --> 00:36:06,160
This is going to
be an upper bound.

725
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,720
We don't always add 1, but
worst case, we always had 1,

726
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,880
let's say.

727
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,220
And then there's
this annoying part.

728
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,500
And this might happen,
might not happen.

729
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:20,340
So then there's a plus maybe.

730
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:23,310
If this happens, we
decrease the potential

731
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:26,310
because we empty out the
mods for that node in terms

732
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,720
of the latest version.

733
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:34,500
So then we get a negative
2cp, change in potential.

734
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:42,120
And then we'd have to pay
I guess up to p recursions.

735
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:51,520
Because we have to--

736
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,360
how many pointers
are there to me?

737
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:58,490
Well, at most p of them, because
there are at most p pointers

738
00:36:58,490 --> 00:36:59,270
to any node.

739
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:03,350
OK.

740
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:05,110
This is kind of a weird--

741
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:06,510
it's not exactly algebra here.

742
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:09,736
I have this thing, recursions.

743
00:37:09,736 --> 00:37:11,610
But if you think about
how this would expand,

744
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:13,160
all right, this
is constant time.

745
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,020
That's good.

746
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,020
And then if we do this--

747
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,160
I'll put a question mark here.

748
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,868
It might be here.

749
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:18,110
It might not.

750
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,820
If it's not here, find constant.

751
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:24,280
If it is here, then this gets
expanded into this thing.

752
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,130
It's a weird way to
write a recurrence.

753
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:30,540
But we get p times whatever
is in this right hand side.

754
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,040
OK.

755
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,440
But then there's this minus 2cp.

756
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,560
So we're going to
get p times 2c here.

757
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,850
That's the initial cost.

758
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:40,040
So that will cancel with this.

759
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,910
And then we might get
another recursion.

760
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:43,910
But every time we get a
recursion, all the terms

761
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:44,899
cancel.

762
00:37:44,899 --> 00:37:46,940
So it doesn't matter
whether this is here or not.

763
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:49,610
You get 0, which is great.

764
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:53,400
And you're left with
the original 2c.

765
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,410
Constant.

766
00:37:55,410 --> 00:37:56,300
OK.

767
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:59,120
[INAUDIBLE] potential functions
are always a little crazy.

768
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:03,530
What's happening here is
that, OK, maybe you add a mod.

769
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:05,150
That's cheap.

770
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:08,150
But when we have to do this
work and we have to do this

771
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:14,390
recursion-- this is up to
2p updates or recursions--

772
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:17,270
we are charging it to the
emptying of this node.

773
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:21,110
The number of mods
went from 2p down to 0.

774
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,940
And so we're just
charging this update cost

775
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,059
to that modification.

776
00:38:24,059 --> 00:38:26,600
So if you like charging schemes,
this is much more intuitive.

777
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,500
But with charging schemes,
it's always a little careful.

778
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,860
You have to make sure
you're not double charging.

779
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:34,790
Here it's obvious that
you're not double charging.

780
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:37,070
Kind of a cool and magical.

781
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:42,010
This is a paper by
Driscoll, Sarnak, Sleator,

782
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:43,820
Tarjan from 1989.

783
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,620
So it's very early
days of amortization.

784
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,760
But they knew how to do it.

785
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,521
Question?

786
00:38:48,521 --> 00:38:50,504
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

787
00:38:50,504 --> 00:38:52,670
ERIK DEMAINE: What happens
if you overflow the root?

788
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,753
Yeah, I never thought about
the root before today.

789
00:38:54,753 --> 00:38:57,350
But I think the way
to fix the root is

790
00:38:57,350 --> 00:39:02,780
just you have one big table
that says, for a given version--

791
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,326
I guess a simple
way would be to say,

792
00:39:04,326 --> 00:39:06,200
not only is a version
a number, but it's also

793
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,130
a pointer to the root.

794
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:07,629
There we go.

795
00:39:07,629 --> 00:39:09,242
Pointer machine.

796
00:39:09,242 --> 00:39:11,450
So that way you're just
always explicitly maintaining

797
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:15,110
the root copy or the pointer.

798
00:39:15,110 --> 00:39:18,710
Because otherwise,
you're in trouble.

799
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:21,530
AUDIENCE: Then can you
go back to [INAUDIBLE].

800
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:24,310
ERIK DEMAINE: So in order
to refer to an old version,

801
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:26,750
you have to have the
pointer to that root node.

802
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:29,336
If you want to do it just
from a version number,

803
00:39:29,336 --> 00:39:30,460
look at the data structure.

804
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,450
Just from a version
number, you would

805
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:33,249
need some kind of
lookup table, which

806
00:39:33,249 --> 00:39:34,540
is outside the pointer machine.

807
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,280
So you could do it
in a real computer,

808
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,210
but a pointer machine is
not technically allowed.

809
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,570
So it's slightly awkward.

810
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:42,400
No arrays are allowed
in pointer machines,

811
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,483
in case that wasn't clear.

812
00:39:43,483 --> 00:39:44,274
Another question?

813
00:39:44,274 --> 00:39:48,720
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] constant
space to store for [INAUDIBLE].

814
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:54,294
And also, what if we have
really big numbers [INAUDIBLE]?

815
00:39:54,294 --> 00:39:56,710
ERIK DEMAINE: In this model,
in the pointer machine model,

816
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,930
we're assuming that whatever
the data is in the items

817
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:01,480
take constant space each.

818
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,670
If you want to know about
bigger things in here,

819
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,450
then refer to future lectures.

820
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:06,910
This is time travel, after all.

821
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:09,200
Just go to a future
class and then come back.

822
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,920
[LAUGHS] So we'll get
there, but right now,

823
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,121
we're not thinking
about what's in here.

824
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,870
Whatever big thing
you're trying to store,

825
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:19,810
you reduce it down to
constant size things.

826
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:22,840
And then you spread them around
nodes of a pointer machine.

827
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,250
How you do that, that's
up to the data structure.

828
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:28,000
We're just transforming the
data structure to be persistent.

829
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,458
OK, you could ask about other
models than pointer machines,

830
00:40:30,458 --> 00:40:34,530
but we're going to stick
to pointer machines here.

831
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:36,220
All right.

832
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,110
That was partial persistence.

833
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:41,540
Let's do full persistence.

834
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,370
That was too easy.

835
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,970
Same paper does
full persistence.

836
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:50,427
Systems That was just a warm up.

837
00:40:50,427 --> 00:40:52,510
Full persistence is actually
not that much harder.

838
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:57,685
So let me tell you
basically what changes.

839
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,550
There are two issues.

840
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:09,440
One is that everything here
has to change and not by much.

841
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,370
We're still going to
use back pointers.

842
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:12,860
We're still going
to have my mods.

843
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:15,026
The number of mods is going
to be slightly different

844
00:41:15,026 --> 00:41:16,910
but basically the same.

845
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:19,327
Back pointers no longer just
refer to the latest version.

846
00:41:19,327 --> 00:41:21,410
We have to maintain back
pointers in all versions.

847
00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:22,970
So that's annoying.

848
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:24,274
But hey, that's life.

849
00:41:24,274 --> 00:41:25,940
The amortization, the
potential function

850
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:28,190
will change slightly
but basically not much.

851
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:33,116
Sort of the bigger issue you
might first wonder about,

852
00:41:33,116 --> 00:41:35,240
and it's actually the most
challenging technically,

853
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,490
is versions are
no longer numbers.

854
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:39,140
Because it's not a line.

855
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:41,247
Versions are nodes in a tree.

856
00:41:41,247 --> 00:41:42,830
You should probably
call them vertices

857
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:45,121
in a tree to distinguish them
from nodes in the pointer

858
00:41:45,121 --> 00:41:46,580
machine.

859
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:48,530
OK, so you've got
this tree of versions.

860
00:41:48,530 --> 00:41:53,930
And then versions are just
some point on that tree.

861
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:57,020
This is annoying
because we like lines.

862
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,770
We don't like trees as much.

863
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:00,770
So what we're going to
do is linearize the tree.

864
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,900
Like, when in doubt, cheat.

865
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,880
How do we do this?

866
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:15,310
With tree traversal.

867
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:18,240
Imagine I'm going to draw
a super complicated tree

868
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,370
of versions.

869
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,660
Say there are three versions.

870
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:22,807
OK.

871
00:42:22,807 --> 00:42:24,890
I don't want to number
them, because that would be

872
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:26,330
kind of begging the question.

873
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:30,530
So let's just call
them x, y, and z.

874
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,384
All right.

875
00:42:34,384 --> 00:42:36,050
I mean, it's a directed
tree, because we

876
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:37,464
have the older versions.

877
00:42:37,464 --> 00:42:38,880
This is like the
original version.

878
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,754
And we made a change.

879
00:42:39,754 --> 00:42:42,690
We made a different change
on the same version.

880
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:45,520
What I'd like to do is a
traversal of that tree,

881
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,170
like a regular, as if you're
going to sort those nodes.

882
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:53,420
Actually, let me use
color, high def here.

883
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,820
So here's our
traversal of the tree.

884
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:01,790
And I want to look at the
first and the last time I

885
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:02,730
visit each node.

886
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:05,360
So here's the first
time I visit x.

887
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:09,250
So I'll write this is
the beginning of x.

888
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:13,550
Capital X. Then this is
the first time I visit y,

889
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:15,530
so it's beginning of y.

890
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:19,070
And then this is the last time
I visit y, so it's the end of y.

891
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:20,770
And then, don't care.

892
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:24,800
Then this is the beginning of z.

893
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,230
And this is the end of z.

894
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:29,480
And then this is the end x.

895
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:38,830
If I write those sequentially,
I get bxbyeybzez,

896
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:42,400
because this is so easy, ex.

897
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,530
OK, you can think of these
as parentheses, right?

898
00:43:45,530 --> 00:43:48,460
For whatever reason I chose b
and e for beginning and ending,

899
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:50,360
but this is like open
parens, close parens.

900
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,310
This is easy to
do in linear time.

901
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:53,690
I think you all know how.

902
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:55,066
Except it's not
a static problem.

903
00:43:55,066 --> 00:43:56,523
Versions are changing
all the time.

904
00:43:56,523 --> 00:43:57,500
We're adding versions.

905
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,458
We're never deleting
versions, but we're always

906
00:43:59,458 --> 00:44:00,422
adding stuff to here.

907
00:44:00,422 --> 00:44:01,880
It's a little
awkward, but the idea

908
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:05,840
is I want to
maintain this order,

909
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:16,010
maintain the begin and
the end of each you

910
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:17,315
might say subtree of versions.

911
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,770
This string, from
bx to ex, represents

912
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:29,820
all of the stuff in x's
subtree, in the rooted tree

913
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:30,660
starting at x.

914
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:34,930
How do I maintain that?

915
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:42,009
Using a data structure.

916
00:44:56,490 --> 00:45:00,830
So we're going to use something,
a data structure we haven't yet

917
00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:02,210
seen.

918
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:04,899
It will be in lecture 8.

919
00:45:04,899 --> 00:45:06,440
This is a time travel
data structure,

920
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:10,280
so I'm allowed to do that.

921
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:14,150
So order maintenance
data structure.

922
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:16,970
You can think of this as
a magical linked list.

923
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:19,520
Let me tell you what the
magical linked list can do.

924
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,871
You can insert--

925
00:45:22,871 --> 00:45:24,620
I'm going to call it
an item, because node

926
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:28,640
would be kind of confusing
given where we are right now.

927
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,480
You can insert a new item in
the list immediately before

928
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,850
or after a given item.

929
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:37,910
OK.

930
00:45:37,910 --> 00:45:41,390
This is like a
regular linked list.

931
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:44,750
Here's a regular linked list.

932
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:48,290
And if I'm given a particular
item like this one,

933
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:51,190
I can say, well, insert
a new item right here.

934
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:51,721
You say, OK.

935
00:45:51,721 --> 00:45:52,220
Fine.

936
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:57,060
I'll just make a new node and
relink here, relink there.

937
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:58,190
Constant time, right?

938
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:00,050
So in an order maintenance
data structure,

939
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:01,940
you can do this
in constant time.

940
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:02,900
Wow!

941
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:05,180
So amazing.

942
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:08,410
OK, catch is the second
operation you can do.

943
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:09,410
Maybe I'll number these.

944
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:10,970
This is the update.

945
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:13,490
Then there's the query.

946
00:46:13,490 --> 00:46:17,990
The query is, what
is the relative order

947
00:46:17,990 --> 00:46:20,360
of two notes, of two items?

948
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:27,090
x and y.

949
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:29,980
So now I give you this
node and this node.

950
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:32,420
And I say, which is to the left?

951
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:34,030
Which is earlier in the order?

952
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:36,070
I want to know, is x
basically less than y

953
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:37,690
in terms of the
order in the list?

954
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:41,136
Or is y less than x?

955
00:46:41,136 --> 00:46:42,760
And an order maintenance
data structure

956
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,910
can do this in constant time.

957
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:50,486
Now it doesn't look like your
mother's linked list, I guess.

958
00:46:50,486 --> 00:46:52,360
It's not the link list
you learned in school.

959
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,700
It's a magical linked
list that can somehow

960
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:55,810
answer these queries.

961
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:56,510
How?

962
00:46:56,510 --> 00:46:58,770
Go to lecture 7.

963
00:46:58,770 --> 00:46:59,270
OK.

964
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:03,174
Forward reference,
lecture 8, sorry.

965
00:47:03,174 --> 00:47:05,590
For now, we're just going to
assume that this magical data

966
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:06,740
structure exists.

967
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,340
So in constant
time, this is great.

968
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:11,680
Because if we're maintaining
these b's and e's, we

969
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:16,090
want to maintain the order
that these things appear in.

970
00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:17,620
If we want to create
a new version,

971
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:20,410
like suppose we were
just creating version z,

972
00:47:20,410 --> 00:47:23,140
well, it used to be everything
without this bz, ez.

973
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:27,215
And we'd just insert two
items in here, bz and ez.

974
00:47:27,215 --> 00:47:28,590
They're right next
to each other.

975
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:30,820
And if we were given version
x, we could just say,

976
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:34,300
oh, we'll look at ex and insert
two items right before it.

977
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,069
Or you can put them
right after bx.

978
00:47:36,069 --> 00:47:37,610
I mean, there's no
actual order here.

979
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:40,690
So it could have been y first
and then z or z first and then

980
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:42,070
y.

981
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:44,610
So it's really easy to add a
new version in constant time.

982
00:47:44,610 --> 00:47:47,590
You just do two of
these insert operations.

983
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:50,680
And now you have this magical
order operation, which

984
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:54,500
if I'm given two versions--

985
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,800
I don't know, v and w--

986
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,250
and I want to know is
v an ancestor of w,

987
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:02,390
now I can do it
in constant time.

988
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:09,700
So this lets me do a third
operation, which is, is version

989
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:21,850
v an ancestor of version w?

990
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:26,350
Because that's going to
be true if and only if bv

991
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:37,195
is an ev nest around bw and ew.

992
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:40,290
OK.

993
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:41,920
So that's just three tests.

994
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,980
They're probably not
all even necessary.

995
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:45,390
This one always holds.

996
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:50,670
But if these guys fit in between
these guys, then you know--

997
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:54,810
now, what this tells us,
what we care about here,

998
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:58,020
is reading fields.

999
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,300
When we read a field,
we said, oh, we'll

1000
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:02,670
apply all the modifications
that apply to version

1001
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:04,510
v. Before that, that
was a linear order.

1002
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:06,900
So it's just all versions
less than or equal to v. Now

1003
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:10,800
it's all versions that are
ancestors of v. Given a mod,

1004
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,830
we need to know, does this
mod apply to my version?

1005
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:16,560
And now I tell you, I can
do that in constant time

1006
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,610
through magic.

1007
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:20,340
I just test these
order relations.

1008
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:24,360
If they hold, then that
mod applies to my version.

1009
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:27,360
So w's the version
we're testing.

1010
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,430
v is some version in the mod.

1011
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:32,070
And I want to know, am
descendant of that version?

1012
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:34,100
If so, the mod applies.

1013
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:36,630
And I update what the field is.

1014
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:39,030
I can do all pairwise ancestor
checks and figure out,

1015
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:43,200
what is the most recent
version in my ancestor history

1016
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,850
that modified a given field?

1017
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:47,080
That lets me read a
field in constant time.

1018
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,080
Constants are getting
kind of big at this point,

1019
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:50,040
but it can be done.

1020
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:54,550
Clear?

1021
00:49:54,550 --> 00:49:56,850
A little bit of
a black box here.

1022
00:49:56,850 --> 00:50:01,920
But now we've gotten
as far as reading.

1023
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:04,750
And we don't need
to change much else.

1024
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:11,780
So this is good news

1025
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:15,280
Maybe I'll give you
a bit of a diff.

1026
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:26,340
So full persistence,
fully persistent theorem--

1027
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:27,210
done.

1028
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:27,710
OK.

1029
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:30,080
Same theorem just
with full persistence.

1030
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:31,230
How do we do it?

1031
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:35,542
We store back pointers
now for all versions.

1032
00:50:35,542 --> 00:50:36,870
It's a little bit annoying.

1033
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:40,832
But how many mods do we use?

1034
00:50:40,832 --> 00:50:42,540
There's lots of ways
to get this to work,

1035
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:44,890
but I'm going to
change this number

1036
00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:51,702
to 2 times d plus p plus 1.

1037
00:50:51,702 --> 00:50:56,450
Wait, what's d? d is the
number of fields here.

1038
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:57,140
OK.

1039
00:50:57,140 --> 00:50:59,150
We said it was
constant number fields.

1040
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:03,680
I never said what that constant
is. d for out degree, I guess.

1041
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:09,289
So p is in degree, max in
degree. d is max out degree.

1042
00:51:09,289 --> 00:51:11,330
So just slightly more--
that main reason for this

1043
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:14,450
is because back pointers now
are treated like everyone else.

1044
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:17,434
We have to treat both the out
pointers and the in pointers

1045
00:51:17,434 --> 00:51:18,350
as basically the same.

1046
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:19,880
So instead of p,
we have d plus p.

1047
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:23,231
And there's a plus
1 just for safety.

1048
00:51:23,231 --> 00:51:28,330
It gets my amortization
to work, hopefully.

1049
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:29,320
OK.

1050
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:32,430
Not much else-- this
page is all the same.

1051
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:35,830
Mods are still, you give
versions, fields, values,

1052
00:51:35,830 --> 00:51:36,620
reading.

1053
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:41,030
OK, well, this is no longer
less than or equal to v. But

1054
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:47,060
this is now with a version, sort
of the nearest version, that's

1055
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:50,660
an ancestor of v.

1056
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:52,719
That's what we were
just talking about.

1057
00:51:52,719 --> 00:51:54,260
So that can be done
in constant time.

1058
00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:57,400
Check it for all of
them, constant work.

1059
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,130
OK.

1060
00:51:58,130 --> 00:52:00,490
That was the first part.

1061
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:07,160
Now we get to the hard
part, which is modification.

1062
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:08,410
This is going to be different.

1063
00:52:08,410 --> 00:52:10,810
Maybe you I should just erase--

1064
00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:13,690
yeah, I think I'll
erase everything,

1065
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:14,930
except the first clause.

1066
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:24,890
OK.

1067
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:26,910
If a node is not
full, we'll just

1068
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:28,460
add a mod, just like before.

1069
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:31,040
What changes is
when a node is full.

1070
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,220
Here we have to do something
completely different.

1071
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:38,910
Why?

1072
00:52:38,910 --> 00:52:41,070
Because if we just
make a new version

1073
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:45,050
of this node that has empty
mods, this one's still full.

1074
00:52:45,050 --> 00:52:48,810
And I can keep modifying
the same version.

1075
00:52:48,810 --> 00:52:52,830
This new node that I just erased
represents some new version.

1076
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:54,720
But if I keep modifying
an old version, which

1077
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:57,760
I can do in full persistence,
this node keeps being full.

1078
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,019
And I keep paying
potentially huge cost.

1079
00:53:00,019 --> 00:53:02,310
If all the nodes were full,
and when I make this change

1080
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:04,764
every node gets
copied, and then I

1081
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:06,180
make a change to
the same version,

1082
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:07,388
every node gets copied again.

1083
00:53:07,388 --> 00:53:09,860
This is going to take
linear time per operation.

1084
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:11,940
So I can't do the old strategy.

1085
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:15,304
I need to somehow make
this node less full.

1086
00:53:15,304 --> 00:53:17,220
This is where we're
definitely not functional.

1087
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:19,050
None of this was
functional, but now I'm

1088
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:24,240
going to change an old node, not
just make a new one in a more

1089
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,860
drastic way.

1090
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:27,060
Before I was adding a mod.

1091
00:53:27,060 --> 00:53:28,560
That's not a
functional operation.

1092
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:33,870
Now I'm actually going to remove
mods from a node to rebalance.

1093
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:43,050
So what I'd like to do is
split the node into two halves.

1094
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:43,550
OK.

1095
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:46,295
So I had some big
node that was--

1096
00:53:46,295 --> 00:53:50,190
I'll draw it-- completely full.

1097
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:52,890
Now I'm going to make two nodes.

1098
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:53,820
Here we go.

1099
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:01,030
This one is going
to be half full.

1100
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:04,930
This one's going to
be half full of mods.

1101
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:05,460
OK.

1102
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:08,100
The only question left is, what
do I do with all these things?

1103
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:14,700
Basically what I'd like
to do is have the--

1104
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:18,720
on the one hand, I want
to have the old node.

1105
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,550
It's just where it used to be.

1106
00:54:20,550 --> 00:54:23,820
I've just removed half of
the mods, the second half,

1107
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:25,710
the later half.

1108
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:26,740
What does that mean?

1109
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:27,420
I don't know.

1110
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:29,320
Figure it out.

1111
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,050
It's linearized.

1112
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:32,710
I haven't thought
deeply about that.

1113
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:36,300
Now we're going to make a
new node with the second half

1114
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:36,880
of the mods.

1115
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,640
It's more painful
than I thought.

1116
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:45,180
In reality, these mods represent
a tree of modifications.

1117
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:48,450
And what you need to do is
find a partition of that tree

1118
00:54:48,450 --> 00:54:51,000
into two roughly equal halves.

1119
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,870
You can actually do a
one third, 2/3 split.

1120
00:54:52,870 --> 00:54:57,049
That's also in a future lecture,
which whose number I forget.

1121
00:54:57,049 --> 00:54:58,590
So really, you're
splitting this tree

1122
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:01,440
into two roughly
balanced halves.

1123
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:03,750
And so this 2 might actually
need to change to a 3,

1124
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:06,330
but it's a constant.

1125
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:07,590
OK.

1126
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:09,330
What I want is for
this to represent

1127
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:10,350
a subtree of versions.

1128
00:55:10,350 --> 00:55:11,860
Let me draw the picture.

1129
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:15,180
So here's a tree of versions
represented by the old mods.

1130
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:18,580
I'd like to cut out a
subtree rooted at some node.

1131
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:21,540
So let's just assume
for now this has exactly

1132
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:22,890
half the nodes.

1133
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:25,470
And this has half the nodes.

1134
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:29,180
In reality, I think it
can be one third, 2/3.

1135
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:29,680
OK.

1136
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:32,930
But let's keep it convenient.

1137
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:34,750
So I want the new
node to represent

1138
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:37,630
this subtree and this node
to represent everything else.

1139
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:41,650
This node is as if this
stuff hasn't happened yet.

1140
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:44,714
I mean, so it represents all
these old versions that do not,

1141
00:55:44,714 --> 00:55:45,880
that are not in the subtree.

1142
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:47,800
This represents all
the latest stuff.

1143
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,750
So what I'm going to
do is like before, I

1144
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:54,090
want to apply some
mods to these fields.

1145
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:58,320
And whatever minds were
relevant at this point, whatever

1146
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:02,610
had been applied, I apply
those to the fields here.

1147
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:06,900
And so that means I can
remove all of these mods.

1148
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:09,360
I only cared about these ones.

1149
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:11,220
Update these fields accordingly.

1150
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:14,040
I still have the other mods to
represent all the other changes

1151
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:16,030
that could be in that subtree.

1152
00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:16,530
OK.

1153
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:33,255
So we actually split the tree,
and we apply mods to new nodes.

1154
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:40,050
Anything else I need to say?

1155
00:56:42,542 --> 00:56:44,000
Oh, now we need to
update pointers.

1156
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,124
That's always the fun part.

1157
00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:50,530
Let's go over here.

1158
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,490
So old node hasn't moved.

1159
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:09,150
But this new node has moved.

1160
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:13,880
So for all of these
versions, I want

1161
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:18,020
to change the pointer that
used to point to old node

1162
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:20,806
should now point to new node.

1163
00:57:20,806 --> 00:57:21,930
In this version, it's fine.

1164
00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:23,150
It should still
point to old node,

1165
00:57:23,150 --> 00:57:25,280
because this represents
all those old versions.

1166
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:28,170
But for the new version,
that version in the subtree,

1167
00:57:28,170 --> 00:57:30,781
I've got to point here instead.

1168
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:31,280
OK.

1169
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:37,330
So how many pointers could
there be to this node

1170
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:38,850
that need to change.

1171
00:57:38,850 --> 00:57:41,630
That's a tricky part
in this analysis.

1172
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:45,200
Think about it for a while.

1173
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,200
I mean, in this
new node, whatever

1174
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:50,222
is pointed to by either here or
here in the new node also has

1175
00:57:50,222 --> 00:57:50,930
a return pointer.

1176
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:52,130
All pointers are bidirectional.

1177
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:54,338
So we don't really care
about whether they're forward

1178
00:57:54,338 --> 00:57:54,926
or backward.

1179
00:57:54,926 --> 00:57:56,300
How many pointers
are there here?

1180
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:59,360
Well, there's d here
and there's p here.

1181
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:01,280
But then there's also
some additional pointers

1182
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,750
represented over here.

1183
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:04,100
How many?

1184
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:06,890
Well, if we assume this
magical 50/50 split,

1185
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:12,920
there's right now d plus p plus
1 mods over here, half of them.

1186
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:16,100
Each of them might be a pointer
to some other place, which

1187
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:18,715
has a return pointer
in that version.

1188
00:58:18,715 --> 00:58:23,690
So number of back pointers
that we need to update

1189
00:58:23,690 --> 00:58:27,150
is going to be this, 2
times d 2 times p plus 1.

1190
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:41,850
So recursively update at
most 2 times d plus 2 times p

1191
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:44,840
plus 1 pointers to the node.

1192
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:52,550
The good news is this is
really only half of them

1193
00:58:52,550 --> 00:58:54,850
or some fraction of them.

1194
00:58:54,850 --> 00:58:57,417
It used to be--

1195
00:58:57,417 --> 00:58:59,000
well, there were
more pointers before.

1196
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,290
We don't have to
deal with these ones.

1197
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:01,831
That's where we're
saving, and that's

1198
00:59:01,831 --> 00:59:03,622
why this amortization works.

1199
00:59:03,622 --> 00:59:06,080
Let me give you a potential
function that makes this work--

1200
00:59:12,950 --> 00:59:23,760
is minus c times sum of the
number of empty mod slots.

1201
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,370
It's kind of the same
potential but before

1202
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:28,530
we had this notion of
dead and alive nodes.

1203
00:59:28,530 --> 00:59:30,450
Now everything's alive
because everything

1204
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:31,980
could change at any moment.

1205
00:59:31,980 --> 00:59:36,030
So instead, I'm going to
measure how much room I have

1206
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:37,134
in each node.

1207
00:59:37,134 --> 00:59:38,550
Before I had no
room in this node.

1208
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:41,760
Now I have half the
space in both nodes.

1209
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,070
So that's good news.

1210
00:59:44,070 --> 00:59:48,300
Whenever we have
this recursion, we

1211
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:56,630
can charge it to a
potential decrease.

1212
00:59:56,630 --> 01:00:01,160
Fee goes down by--

1213
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:03,720
because I have a
negative sign here--

1214
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:13,740
c times, oh man, 2 times
d plus p plus 1, I think.

1215
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:15,780
Because there's d plus
p plus 1 space here,

1216
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:17,230
d plus p plus 1 space here.

1217
01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:18,990
I mean, we added
one whole new node.

1218
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:20,820
And total capacity
of a node in mods

1219
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:23,610
is 2 times d plus p plus 1.

1220
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:26,010
So we get that times c.

1221
01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:28,530
And this is basically
just enough,

1222
01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:32,010
because this is 2 times
d plus 2 times p plus 2.

1223
01:00:32,010 --> 01:00:34,140
And here we have a plus 1.

1224
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:39,690
And so the recursion gets
annihilated by 2 times d plus

1225
01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:41,280
2 times p plus 1.

1226
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:43,440
And then there's one
c left over to absorb

1227
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:47,241
whatever constant cost there
was to do all this other work.

1228
01:00:47,241 --> 01:00:51,570
So I got the constants
just to work,

1229
01:00:51,570 --> 01:00:54,340
except that I cheated and it's
really a one third, 2/3 split.

1230
01:00:54,340 --> 01:00:57,090
So probably all of these
constants have to change,

1231
01:00:57,090 --> 01:00:58,102
such is life.

1232
01:00:58,102 --> 01:01:01,490
But I think you get the idea.

1233
01:01:01,490 --> 01:01:03,900
Any questions about
full persistence?

1234
01:01:07,110 --> 01:01:10,200
This is fun stuff, time travel.

1235
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,426
Yeah?

1236
01:01:11,426 --> 01:01:14,630
AUDIENCE: So in the first
half of the thing where

1237
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:16,583
the if, there's room
you can put it in.

1238
01:01:16,583 --> 01:01:17,056
ERIK DEMAINE: Right.

1239
01:01:17,056 --> 01:01:17,919
AUDIENCE: I have a
question about how

1240
01:01:17,919 --> 01:01:19,421
we represent the version.

1241
01:01:19,421 --> 01:01:23,016
Because before when we said
restore now [INAUDIBLE].

1242
01:01:23,016 --> 01:01:25,920
It made more sense if now was
like a timestamp or something.

1243
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:26,670
ERIK DEMAINE: OK.

1244
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:31,470
Right, so how do we represent a
version even here or anywhere?

1245
01:01:31,470 --> 01:01:34,230
When we do a modification, an
update, in the data structure,

1246
01:01:34,230 --> 01:01:36,420
we want to return
the new version.

1247
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:39,810
Basically, we're going
to actually store

1248
01:01:39,810 --> 01:01:41,042
the DAG of versions.

1249
01:01:41,042 --> 01:01:43,250
And a version is going to
be represented by a pointer

1250
01:01:43,250 --> 01:01:44,400
into this DAG.

1251
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,340
One of the nodes in this
DAG becomes a version.

1252
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:50,400
Every node in this DAG is
going to store a pointer

1253
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:53,640
to the corresponding b character
and a corresponding e character

1254
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:56,460
in this data
structure, which then

1255
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:57,924
lets you do anything you want.

1256
01:01:57,924 --> 01:01:59,590
Then you can query
against that version,

1257
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:01,690
whether it's an ancestor
of another version.

1258
01:02:01,690 --> 01:02:02,981
So yeah, I didn't mention that.

1259
01:02:02,981 --> 01:02:04,230
Versions are nodes in here.

1260
01:02:04,230 --> 01:02:06,647
Nodes in here have pointers
to the b's and e's.

1261
01:02:06,647 --> 01:02:08,730
And vice versa, the b's
and e's have pointers back

1262
01:02:08,730 --> 01:02:10,731
to the corresponding
version node.

1263
01:02:10,731 --> 01:02:12,480
And then you can keep
track of everything.

1264
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,790
Good question.

1265
01:02:14,790 --> 01:02:15,390
Yeah?

1266
01:02:15,390 --> 01:02:16,270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] question.

1267
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:17,150
Remind me what d is in this.

1268
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:19,108
ERIK DEMAINE: Oh, d was
the maximum out degree.

1269
01:02:19,108 --> 01:02:26,970
It's the number of fields in
a node, as defined right here.

1270
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:29,701
Other questions?

1271
01:02:29,701 --> 01:02:30,200
Whew.

1272
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:31,305
OK, a little breather.

1273
01:02:31,305 --> 01:02:33,450
That was partial persistence,
full persistence.

1274
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:36,730
This is, unfortunately, the
end of the really good results.

1275
01:02:36,730 --> 01:02:38,650
As long as we have
constant degree nodes,

1276
01:02:38,650 --> 01:02:41,320
in and out degree,
we can do all.

1277
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:44,830
We can do for
persistence for free.

1278
01:02:44,830 --> 01:02:47,080
Obviously there are practical
constants involved here.

1279
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:53,170
But in theory, you
can do this perfectly.

1280
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:54,830
Before we go on to
confluence, there

1281
01:02:54,830 --> 01:02:58,210
is one positive result,
which is what if you

1282
01:02:58,210 --> 01:03:00,615
don't like amortize bounds.

1283
01:03:00,615 --> 01:03:02,740
There are various reasons
amortize bounds might not

1284
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:03,070
be good.

1285
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:04,861
Maybe you really care
about every operation

1286
01:03:04,861 --> 01:03:08,740
being no slower than it was
except by a constant factor.

1287
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:11,500
We're amortizing here, so some
operations get really slow.

1288
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:14,110
But the others are all
fast to compensate.

1289
01:03:14,110 --> 01:03:19,540
You can deamortize, it's called.

1290
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:30,280
You can get constant
worst case slowdown

1291
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:31,870
for partial persistence.

1292
01:03:36,770 --> 01:03:44,260
This is a result of Garret
Brodle from the late '90s, '97.

1293
01:03:44,260 --> 01:03:47,149
For full persistence--
so it's an open problem.

1294
01:03:47,149 --> 01:03:48,940
I don't know if people
have worked on that.

1295
01:03:55,801 --> 01:03:56,300
All right.

1296
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:59,515
So some, mostly good results.

1297
01:03:59,515 --> 01:04:01,640
Let's move on to confluent
persistence where things

1298
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:03,606
get a lot more challenging.

1299
01:04:17,511 --> 01:04:20,010
Lots of things go out the window
with confluent persistence.

1300
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:23,520
In particular, your
versions are now a DAG.

1301
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,650
It's a lot harder
to linearize a DAG.

1302
01:04:25,650 --> 01:04:28,980
Trees are not that
far from pads.

1303
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:33,672
But DAGs are quite far
from pads, unfortunately.

1304
01:04:33,672 --> 01:04:35,130
But that's not all
that goes wrong.

1305
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:50,060
Let me first tell you the
kind of end effect as a user.

1306
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:52,060
Imagine you have
a data structure.

1307
01:04:54,830 --> 01:04:57,500
Think of it as a
list, I guess, which

1308
01:04:57,500 --> 01:04:59,330
is a list of characters
in your document.

1309
01:04:59,330 --> 01:05:03,410
You're using vi or Word,
your favorite, whatever.

1310
01:05:03,410 --> 01:05:05,060
It's a text editor.

1311
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:06,680
You've got a string of words.

1312
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:09,785
And now you like to do
things like copy and paste.

1313
01:05:09,785 --> 01:05:11,270
It's a nice operation.

1314
01:05:11,270 --> 01:05:16,340
So you select an interval of
the string and you copy it.

1315
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:18,340
And then you paste
it somewhere else.

1316
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:21,950
So now you've got two
copies of that string.

1317
01:05:21,950 --> 01:05:24,050
This is, in some
sense, what you might

1318
01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:27,960
call a confluent
operation, because--

1319
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:30,470
yeah, maybe a cleaner way to
think of it is the following.

1320
01:05:30,470 --> 01:05:31,910
You have your string.

1321
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:33,950
Now I have an operation,
which is split it.

1322
01:05:33,950 --> 01:05:35,840
So now I have two strings.

1323
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:36,340
OK.

1324
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:38,298
And now I have an operation,
which is split it.

1325
01:05:38,298 --> 01:05:40,770
Now I have three strings.

1326
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:41,270
OK.

1327
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:44,280
Now I have an operation
which is concatenate.

1328
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:47,330
So I can, for
example, reconstruct

1329
01:05:47,330 --> 01:05:49,850
the original string-- actually,
I have the original string.

1330
01:05:49,850 --> 01:05:51,940
No biggie.

1331
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:54,470
Let's say-- because
I have all versions.

1332
01:05:54,470 --> 01:05:55,520
I never lose them.

1333
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:59,090
So now instead, I'm going to
cut the string here, let's say.

1334
01:05:59,090 --> 01:06:03,710
So now I have this and this.

1335
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:06,620
And now I can do
things like concatenate

1336
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:10,010
from here to here to here.

1337
01:06:10,010 --> 01:06:16,801
And I will get this
plus this plus this.

1338
01:06:16,801 --> 01:06:17,300
OK.

1339
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:18,579
This guy moved here.

1340
01:06:18,579 --> 01:06:20,870
So that's a copy/paste
operation with a constant number

1341
01:06:20,870 --> 01:06:22,100
of splits and concatenates.

1342
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:23,810
I could also do cut and paste.

1343
01:06:23,810 --> 01:06:26,720
With confluence, I can
do crazy cuts and pastes

1344
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:28,950
in all sorts of ways.

1345
01:06:28,950 --> 01:06:29,910
So what?

1346
01:06:29,910 --> 01:06:32,120
Well, the so what
is I can actually

1347
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:33,990
double the size of
my data structure

1348
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:36,050
in a constant number
of operations.

1349
01:06:36,050 --> 01:06:38,270
I can take, for example,
the entire string

1350
01:06:38,270 --> 01:06:40,031
and concatenate it to itself.

1351
01:06:40,031 --> 01:06:41,780
That will double the
number of characters,

1352
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:43,740
number of elements in there.

1353
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:45,900
I can do that again
and again and again.

1354
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:51,380
So in u updates,
I can potentially

1355
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:53,000
get a data structure
size 2 to the u.

1356
01:06:57,770 --> 01:06:58,610
Kind of nifty.

1357
01:06:58,610 --> 01:07:00,350
I think this is why
confluence is cool.

1358
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:02,700
It's also why it's hard.

1359
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:03,900
So not a big surprise.

1360
01:07:03,900 --> 01:07:08,130
But, here we go.

1361
01:07:08,130 --> 01:07:13,490
In that case, the version DAG,
for reference, looks like this.

1362
01:07:13,490 --> 01:07:16,180
You're taking the same
version, combining it.

1363
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:20,460
So here I'm assuming I have
a concatenate operation.

1364
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:24,240
And so the effect here,
every time I do this,

1365
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:25,140
I double the size.

1366
01:07:44,210 --> 01:07:44,817
All right.

1367
01:07:44,817 --> 01:07:46,900
What do I want to say about
confluent persistence?

1368
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:47,399
All right.

1369
01:07:47,399 --> 01:07:53,200
Let me start with the
most general result, which

1370
01:07:53,200 --> 01:08:04,340
is by Fiat and Kaplan in 2003.

1371
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:08,817
They define a notion called
effective depth of a version.

1372
01:08:08,817 --> 01:08:09,900
Let me just write it down.

1373
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:24,870
It's kind of like
if you took this DAG

1374
01:08:24,870 --> 01:08:30,113
and expanded it out to be a
tree of all possible paths.

1375
01:08:30,113 --> 01:08:31,529
Instead of point
to the same node,

1376
01:08:31,529 --> 01:08:33,330
you could just
duplicate that node

1377
01:08:33,330 --> 01:08:35,260
and then have pointers
left and right.

1378
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:35,760
OK.

1379
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:38,218
So if I did that, of course,
this size grows exponentially.

1380
01:08:38,218 --> 01:08:41,310
It explicitly represents the
size of my data structure.

1381
01:08:41,310 --> 01:08:42,810
At the bottom, if
I have u things,

1382
01:08:42,810 --> 01:08:45,960
I'm going to have 2 to the
u leaves at the bottom.

1383
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:49,080
But then I can easily
measure the number of paths

1384
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:50,500
from the root to
the same version.

1385
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:52,250
At the bottom, I still
label it, oh, those

1386
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:54,630
are all v. They're all the
same version down there.

1387
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:56,664
So exponential number
of paths, if I take log,

1388
01:08:56,664 --> 01:08:58,080
I get what I call
effective depth.

1389
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:02,250
It's like if you somehow
could rebalance that tree,

1390
01:09:02,250 --> 01:09:05,910
this is the best you
could hope to do.

1391
01:09:05,910 --> 01:09:07,270
It's not really a lower bound.

1392
01:09:07,270 --> 01:09:08,040
But it's a number.

1393
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:09,000
It's a thing.

1394
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,470
OK.

1395
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:17,370
Then the result they achieve
is that the overhead is

1396
01:09:17,370 --> 01:09:19,790
log the number of
updates plus-- this

1397
01:09:19,790 --> 01:09:22,290
is a multiplicative overhead,
so you take your running time.

1398
01:09:22,290 --> 01:09:25,979
You multiply it by this.

1399
01:09:25,979 --> 01:09:28,649
And this is a time
and a space overhead.

1400
01:09:31,529 --> 01:09:34,260
So maximum effective depth
of all versions, maybe even

1401
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:39,100
sum of effective depths, but
we'll just say max to be safe.

1402
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:41,800
Sorry-- sum over
all the operations.

1403
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:43,129
This is per operation.

1404
01:09:43,129 --> 01:09:44,670
You pay basically
the effective depth

1405
01:09:44,670 --> 01:09:48,779
of that operation as a factor.

1406
01:09:48,779 --> 01:09:51,330
Now, the annoying thing is if
you have this kind of set up

1407
01:09:51,330 --> 01:09:54,720
where the size
grew exponentially,

1408
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:56,490
then number of paths
is exponential.

1409
01:09:56,490 --> 01:09:59,220
Log of the number of
paths is linear in u.

1410
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:06,420
And so this factor could be
as much as u, linear slowdown.

1411
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:08,820
Now, Fiat and Kaplan argue
linear slowdown is not

1412
01:10:08,820 --> 01:10:13,440
that bad, because if you weren't
even persistent, if you did

1413
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:18,410
this in the naive way of
just recopying the data,

1414
01:10:18,410 --> 01:10:21,579
you were actually spending
exponential time to build

1415
01:10:21,579 --> 01:10:22,620
the final data structure.

1416
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:23,619
It has exponential size.

1417
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:26,800
Just to represent it explicitly
requires exponential time,

1418
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,820
so losing a linear
factor to do u operations

1419
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:31,800
and now u squared time
instead of 2 to the u.

1420
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:35,190
So it's a big
improvement to do this.

1421
01:10:35,190 --> 01:10:40,440
The downside of this approach is
that even if you have a version

1422
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:43,410
DAG that looks like this,
even if the size of the data

1423
01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:46,402
structure is staying
normal, staying linear, so

1424
01:10:46,402 --> 01:10:48,360
this potential, you could
be doubling the size.

1425
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:49,920
But we don't know what
this merge operation is.

1426
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,794
Maybe it just throws
away one of the versions

1427
01:10:51,794 --> 01:10:53,220
or does something--

1428
01:10:53,220 --> 01:10:55,230
somehow takes half
the nodes from one

1429
01:10:55,230 --> 01:10:57,188
side, half the nodes from
the other side maybe.

1430
01:10:57,188 --> 01:10:58,830
These operations
do preserve size.

1431
01:10:58,830 --> 01:11:02,520
Then there's no great reason why
it should be a linear slowdown,

1432
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:03,671
but it is.

1433
01:11:03,671 --> 01:11:04,170
OK?

1434
01:11:04,170 --> 01:11:07,650
So it's all right but not great.

1435
01:11:10,830 --> 01:11:13,560
And it's the best
general result we know.

1436
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:15,540
They also prove a lower bound.

1437
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:30,345
So lower bound is some effect
of depth, total bits of space.

1438
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:37,730
OK.

1439
01:11:37,730 --> 01:11:40,020
What does this mean?

1440
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:42,170
So even if this
is not happening,

1441
01:11:42,170 --> 01:11:44,150
the number of bits
of space you need

1442
01:11:44,150 --> 01:11:45,800
in the worst case--
this does not

1443
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,810
apply to every data structure.

1444
01:11:47,810 --> 01:11:49,790
That's one catch.

1445
01:11:49,790 --> 01:11:52,070
They give a specific
data structure

1446
01:11:52,070 --> 01:11:53,630
where you need this much space.

1447
01:11:53,630 --> 01:11:57,050
So it's similar to
this kind of picture.

1448
01:11:57,050 --> 01:11:58,940
We'll go into the details.

1449
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:00,860
And you need this much space.

1450
01:12:00,860 --> 01:12:02,720
Now, this is kind of
bad, because if there's

1451
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:06,440
u operations, and each of these
is u, that's u squared space.

1452
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:09,395
So we actually need a
factor u blow up in space.

1453
01:12:09,395 --> 01:12:11,290
It looks like.

1454
01:12:11,290 --> 01:12:14,150
But to be more precise,
what this means is

1455
01:12:14,150 --> 01:12:17,270
that you need omega e of
v space, and therefore

1456
01:12:17,270 --> 01:12:27,830
time overhead per update, if--

1457
01:12:27,830 --> 01:12:29,570
this is not written
in the paper--

1458
01:12:29,570 --> 01:12:30,560
queries are free.

1459
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:40,400
Implicit here, they just want
to slow down and increase space

1460
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:43,310
for the updates you do,
which is pretty natural.

1461
01:12:43,310 --> 01:12:46,870
Normally you think of queries
as not increasing space.

1462
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:49,600
But in order to construct
this lower bound,

1463
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:52,360
they actually do
this many queries.

1464
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:55,900
So they do e of v queries
and then one update.

1465
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:59,410
And they say, oh well, space
had to go up by an extra e of v.

1466
01:12:59,410 --> 01:13:02,470
So if you only charge
updates for the space,

1467
01:13:02,470 --> 01:13:04,120
then yes, you have
to lose potentially

1468
01:13:04,120 --> 01:13:07,780
a linear factor, this effect
of death, potentially u.

1469
01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:09,550
But if you also
charge the queries,

1470
01:13:09,550 --> 01:13:13,270
it's still constant
in their example.

1471
01:13:13,270 --> 01:13:18,100
So open question, for
confluent persistence,

1472
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:21,130
can you achieve
constant everything?

1473
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:27,160
Constant time and
space overheads,

1474
01:13:27,160 --> 01:13:33,610
multiplicative
factor per operation,

1475
01:13:33,610 --> 01:13:35,425
both updates and queries.

1476
01:13:35,425 --> 01:13:37,300
So if you charge the
queries, potentially you

1477
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:38,980
could get constant everything.

1478
01:13:38,980 --> 01:13:41,040
This is a relatively
new realization.

1479
01:13:43,890 --> 01:13:47,325
And no one knows
how to do this yet.

1480
01:13:47,325 --> 01:13:47,950
Nice challenge.

1481
01:13:47,950 --> 01:13:50,530
I think maybe we'll work on that
in our first problem session.

1482
01:13:50,530 --> 01:13:51,196
I would like to.

1483
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:54,770
Questions about that result?

1484
01:13:54,770 --> 01:13:56,450
I'm not going to
prove the result.

1485
01:13:56,450 --> 01:13:59,540
But it is a fancy
rebalancing of those kinds

1486
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:02,300
of pictures to get this log.

1487
01:14:10,266 --> 01:14:12,390
There are other results
I'd like to tell you about.

1488
01:14:32,630 --> 01:14:34,710
So brand new result--

1489
01:14:34,710 --> 01:14:35,980
that was from 2003.

1490
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:38,300
This is from 2012--

1491
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:42,590
no, '11, '11, sorry.

1492
01:14:42,590 --> 01:14:47,480
It's SOTO, which is in January,
so it's a little confusing.

1493
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:49,250
Is it '11?

1494
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:50,267
Maybe '12.

1495
01:14:50,267 --> 01:14:51,350
Actually now I'm not sure.

1496
01:14:51,350 --> 01:14:54,750
It's February already, right?

1497
01:14:54,750 --> 01:14:56,870
A January, either this
year or last year.

1498
01:15:00,310 --> 01:15:02,840
It's not as general
a transformation.

1499
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:05,330
It's only going to hold in
what's called a disjoint case.

1500
01:15:05,330 --> 01:15:07,820
But it gets a very good bound--

1501
01:15:07,820 --> 01:15:09,850
not quite constant,
but logarithmic.

1502
01:15:09,850 --> 01:15:12,420
OK, logarithmic
would also be nice.

1503
01:15:12,420 --> 01:15:17,075
Or log, log n, whatever n is.

1504
01:15:17,075 --> 01:15:22,450
Pick your favorite n,
number of operations, say.

1505
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:22,950
OK.

1506
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:39,830
If you assume that confluent
operations are performed only

1507
01:15:39,830 --> 01:15:46,070
on two versions with
no shared nodes--

1508
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:53,870
OK, this would be a way to
forbid this kind of behavior

1509
01:15:53,870 --> 01:15:56,660
where I concatenate the
data structure with itself.

1510
01:15:56,660 --> 01:15:58,520
All the nodes are common.

1511
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:01,840
If I guarantee that maybe I, you
know, slice this up, slice it,

1512
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:03,590
dice it, wherever, and
then re-emerge them

1513
01:16:03,590 --> 01:16:06,230
in some other order, but
I never use two copies

1514
01:16:06,230 --> 01:16:10,130
of the same piece, that
would be a valid confluent

1515
01:16:10,130 --> 01:16:12,260
operation over here.

1516
01:16:12,260 --> 01:16:13,880
This is quite a
strong restriction

1517
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:16,580
that you're not allowed.

1518
01:16:16,580 --> 01:16:19,030
If you try to, who
knows what happens.

1519
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:19,980
Behavior's undefined.

1520
01:16:19,980 --> 01:16:21,830
So won't tell you,
oh, those two versions

1521
01:16:21,830 --> 01:16:22,871
have this node in common.

1522
01:16:22,871 --> 01:16:24,600
You've got to make
a second copy of it.

1523
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:27,099
So somehow you have to guarantee
that control and operations

1524
01:16:27,099 --> 01:16:29,270
never overlap.

1525
01:16:29,270 --> 01:16:30,757
But they can be reordered.

1526
01:16:33,740 --> 01:16:39,500
Then you can get
order log n overhead.

1527
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:40,850
n is the number of operations.

1528
01:16:45,390 --> 01:16:46,970
I have a sketch
of a proof of this

1529
01:16:46,970 --> 01:16:48,870
but not very much
time to talk about it.

1530
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:49,370
All right.

1531
01:16:49,370 --> 01:16:51,570
Let me give you a quick picture.

1532
01:16:51,570 --> 01:16:55,790
In general, the
versions form a DAG.

1533
01:16:55,790 --> 01:17:00,950
But if you make this assumption,
and you look at a single node,

1534
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:03,620
and look at all the versions
where that node appears,

1535
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:05,210
that is a tree.

1536
01:17:05,210 --> 01:17:07,370
Because you're not allowed
to remerge versions

1537
01:17:07,370 --> 01:17:08,720
that have the same node.

1538
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:11,480
So while the big
picture is a DAG,

1539
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:15,090
the small picture of a
single guy is some tree.

1540
01:17:17,504 --> 01:17:18,920
I'm drawing all
these wiggly lines

1541
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:20,000
because there are all
these versions where

1542
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,560
the node isn't changing.

1543
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:23,300
This is the entire version DAG.

1544
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:26,540
And then some of these nodes--

1545
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:29,000
some of these versions,
I should say--

1546
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,925
that node that we're
thinking about changes.

1547
01:17:31,925 --> 01:17:33,860
OK, whenever it
branches, it's probably

1548
01:17:33,860 --> 01:17:36,410
because the actual
node changed, maybe.

1549
01:17:36,410 --> 01:17:37,470
I don't know.

1550
01:17:37,470 --> 01:17:40,170
Anyway there are some dots
here where the version changed,

1551
01:17:40,170 --> 01:17:41,960
some of the leaves,
maybe, that changed.

1552
01:17:41,960 --> 01:17:44,420
Maybe some of them haven't yet.

1553
01:17:44,420 --> 01:17:48,350
In fact, let's see.

1554
01:17:48,350 --> 01:17:51,170
Here where it's change, it could
be that we destroyed the node.

1555
01:17:51,170 --> 01:17:54,560
Maybe it's gone from the
actual data structure.

1556
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,542
But there still may
be versions down here.

1557
01:17:56,542 --> 01:17:57,500
It's not really a tree.

1558
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:59,480
It's a whole DAG of
stuff down there.

1559
01:17:59,480 --> 01:18:01,400
So that's kind of ugly.

1560
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:03,080
Where never the
node still exists,

1561
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:05,300
I guess that is an
actual leaf of the DAG.

1562
01:18:05,300 --> 01:18:06,650
So those are OK.

1563
01:18:06,650 --> 01:18:08,870
But as soon as I maybe
delete that node,

1564
01:18:08,870 --> 01:18:11,610
then there can be a
whole subtree down there.

1565
01:18:11,610 --> 01:18:12,110
OK.

1566
01:18:12,110 --> 01:18:15,120
So now if you look at
an arbitrary version,

1567
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:17,580
so what we're thinking about
is how to implement reading,

1568
01:18:17,580 --> 01:18:18,080
let's say.

1569
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:21,110
Reading and writing are
more or less the same.

1570
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:22,280
I give you a version.

1571
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:23,720
I give you a node, and
I give you a field.

1572
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:26,180
I want to know, what is the
value of that field, that node,

1573
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:27,810
that version?

1574
01:18:27,810 --> 01:18:30,014
So now where could
a version fall?

1575
01:18:30,014 --> 01:18:31,430
Well it has to be
in this subtree.

1576
01:18:31,430 --> 01:18:33,990
Because the node has to exist.

1577
01:18:36,950 --> 01:18:38,390
And then it's maybe a pointer.

1578
01:18:38,390 --> 01:18:42,830
A pointer could be to
another node, which

1579
01:18:42,830 --> 01:18:44,540
also has this kind of picture.

1580
01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:46,460
They could be overlapping trees.

1581
01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:48,140
In general, there
are three cases.

1582
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:51,110
Either you're lucky, and the
version you're talking about

1583
01:18:51,110 --> 01:18:53,960
is a version where
the node was changed.

1584
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:58,470
In that case, the data is
just stored right there.

1585
01:18:58,470 --> 01:18:59,125
That's easy.

1586
01:18:59,125 --> 01:19:01,250
So you could just say, oh,
how did the node change?

1587
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:02,630
Oh, that's what the field is.

1588
01:19:02,630 --> 01:19:05,190
OK, follow the pointer.

1589
01:19:05,190 --> 01:19:08,210
A slightly harder
case it's a version

1590
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:09,590
in between two such changes.

1591
01:19:09,590 --> 01:19:11,660
And maybe these are not updates.

1592
01:19:11,660 --> 01:19:17,330
So I sort of want to know, what
was the previous version where

1593
01:19:17,330 --> 01:19:21,650
this node changed
in constant time?

1594
01:19:21,650 --> 01:19:22,620
It can be done.

1595
01:19:22,620 --> 01:19:25,160
Not constant time,
actually, logarithmic time,

1596
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:28,120
using a data structure
called link-cut trees,

1597
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:31,010
another fun black
box for now, which

1598
01:19:31,010 --> 01:19:36,171
we will cover in lecture
19, far in the future.

1599
01:19:36,171 --> 01:19:36,670
OK.

1600
01:19:39,884 --> 01:19:40,800
Well, that's one case.

1601
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:43,190
There's also the version
where maybe a version

1602
01:19:43,190 --> 01:19:45,110
is down here in a subtree.

1603
01:19:45,110 --> 01:19:48,340
I guess then the
node didn't exist.

1604
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:50,490
Well, all these
things can happen.

1605
01:19:50,490 --> 01:19:51,800
And that's even harder.

1606
01:19:51,800 --> 01:19:53,360
It's messy.

1607
01:19:53,360 --> 01:19:59,720
They use another trick, which
is called fractional cascading,

1608
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:02,240
which I'm not even going to
try to describe what it means.

1609
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:04,190
But it's got a very cool name.

1610
01:20:04,190 --> 01:20:06,080
Because we'll be
covering it in lecture 3.

1611
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:07,284
So stay tuned for that.

1612
01:20:07,284 --> 01:20:09,450
I'm not going to say how
it applies to this setting,

1613
01:20:09,450 --> 01:20:13,330
but it's a necessary
step in here.

1614
01:20:13,330 --> 01:20:15,364
In the remaining
zero minutes, let

1615
01:20:15,364 --> 01:20:17,780
me tell you a little bit about
functional data structures.

1616
01:20:17,780 --> 01:20:20,005
[LAUGHTER]

1617
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:21,910
Beauty of time travel.

1618
01:20:24,830 --> 01:20:31,130
Functional-- I just
want to give you

1619
01:20:31,130 --> 01:20:33,590
some examples of things that
can be done functionally.

1620
01:20:33,590 --> 01:20:35,798
There's a whole book about
functional data structures

1621
01:20:35,798 --> 01:20:36,700
by Okasaki.

1622
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:38,180
It's pretty cool.

1623
01:20:38,180 --> 01:20:42,320
A simple example
is balanced BSTs.

1624
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:44,600
So if you just want to get
log n time for everything,

1625
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:45,890
you can do that functionally.

1626
01:20:45,890 --> 01:20:46,890
It's actually really easy.

1627
01:20:46,890 --> 01:20:48,920
You pick your favorite balance
BST, like red black trees.

1628
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:51,260
You implement it top down so you
never follow parent pointers.

1629
01:20:51,260 --> 01:20:52,710
So you don't need
parent pointers.

1630
01:20:52,710 --> 01:20:57,710
So then as you make changes
down the tree, you just copy.

1631
01:20:57,710 --> 01:20:58,995
It's called path copying.

1632
01:20:58,995 --> 01:21:00,620
Whenever you're about
to make a change,

1633
01:21:00,620 --> 01:21:02,070
make a copy of that node.

1634
01:21:02,070 --> 01:21:05,450
So you end up copying all
the change nodes and all

1635
01:21:05,450 --> 01:21:06,200
their ancestors.

1636
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:09,650
There's only log n of them,
so it takes log n time.

1637
01:21:09,650 --> 01:21:10,500
Clear?

1638
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:11,500
Easy.

1639
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:12,620
It's a nice technique.

1640
01:21:12,620 --> 01:21:14,600
Sometimes path copying
is very useful.

1641
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:16,170
Like link-cut
trees, for example,

1642
01:21:16,170 --> 01:21:17,450
can be made functional.

1643
01:21:17,450 --> 01:21:19,905
We don't know what they are,
but they're basically a BST.

1644
01:21:19,905 --> 01:21:21,280
And you can make
them functional.

1645
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:23,291
We use that in a paper.

1646
01:21:23,291 --> 01:21:23,790
All right.

1647
01:21:23,790 --> 01:21:25,970
Deques.

1648
01:21:25,970 --> 01:21:27,800
These are doubly ended queues.

1649
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:29,990
So it's like a stack and
a queue and everything.

1650
01:21:29,990 --> 01:21:32,900
You can insert and delete from
the beginning and the end.

1651
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:34,730
People start to know
what these are now,

1652
01:21:34,730 --> 01:21:35,980
because Python calls him that.

1653
01:21:35,980 --> 01:21:41,090
But you can also
do concatenation

1654
01:21:41,090 --> 01:21:43,310
with deques in constant
time per operation.

1655
01:21:43,310 --> 01:21:44,150
This is cool.

1656
01:21:44,150 --> 01:21:46,220
Deques are not very
hard to make functional.

1657
01:21:46,220 --> 01:21:48,500
But you can do deques and
you can concatenate them

1658
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:51,980
like we were doing in the figure
that's right behind this board.

1659
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:53,690
Constant time split
is a little harder.

1660
01:21:53,690 --> 01:21:56,870
That's actually one
of my open problems.

1661
01:21:56,870 --> 01:22:01,580
Can you do lists with split and
concatenate in constant time--

1662
01:22:01,580 --> 01:22:05,840
functionally or confluently,
persistently, or whatever?

1663
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:08,580
Another example-- oh, you
can do a mix of the two.

1664
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:12,390
You can get log n search in
constant time deque operations,

1665
01:22:12,390 --> 01:22:14,870
is you can do tries.

1666
01:22:14,870 --> 01:22:17,900
So a try is a tree
with a fixed topology.

1667
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:20,010
Think of it as a directory tree.

1668
01:22:20,010 --> 01:22:21,530
So maybe you're
using Subversion.

1669
01:22:21,530 --> 01:22:23,120
Subversion has time
travel operations.

1670
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:26,240
You can copy an entire
subtree from one version

1671
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:30,620
and stick it into a new
version, another version.

1672
01:22:30,620 --> 01:22:32,685
So you get a version DAG.

1673
01:22:32,685 --> 01:22:34,850
It's a confluently
persistent data structure--

1674
01:22:34,850 --> 01:22:37,610
not implemented optimally,
because we don't necessarily

1675
01:22:37,610 --> 01:22:38,240
know how.

1676
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:40,200
But there is one paper.

1677
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:43,910
This actually came from the open
problem section of this class

1678
01:22:43,910 --> 01:22:45,590
four years ago, I think.

1679
01:22:45,590 --> 01:22:49,520
It's with Eric Price
and Stefan Langerman.

1680
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:50,929
You can get very good results.

1681
01:22:50,929 --> 01:22:52,970
I won't write them down
because it takes a while.

1682
01:22:52,970 --> 01:22:56,450
Basically log the degree
of the nodes factor

1683
01:22:56,450 --> 01:22:59,690
and get functional, and
you can be even fancier

1684
01:22:59,690 --> 01:23:02,480
and get slightly better
bounds like log log the degree

1685
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:05,370
and get confluently persistent
with various tricks,

1686
01:23:05,370 --> 01:23:07,530
including using all of
these data structures.

1687
01:23:07,530 --> 01:23:09,800
So if you want to implement
subversion optimally,

1688
01:23:09,800 --> 01:23:14,390
that is known how to be done but
hasn't actually been done yet.

1689
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:18,110
Because there are those
pesky constant factors.

1690
01:23:18,110 --> 01:23:19,670
I think that's all.

1691
01:23:19,670 --> 01:23:23,030
What is known about functional
is there's a log n separation.

1692
01:23:23,030 --> 01:23:26,890
You can be log n
away from the best.

1693
01:23:26,890 --> 01:23:30,230
That's the worst
separation known,

1694
01:23:30,230 --> 01:23:33,012
between functional and just
a regular old data structure.

1695
01:23:33,012 --> 01:23:34,220
It'd be nice to improve that.

1696
01:23:34,220 --> 01:23:35,345
Lots of open problems here.

1697
01:23:35,345 --> 01:23:38,140
Maybe we'll work
on them next time.
