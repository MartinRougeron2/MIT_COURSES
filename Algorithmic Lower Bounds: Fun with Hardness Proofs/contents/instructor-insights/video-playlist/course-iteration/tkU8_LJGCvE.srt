ERIK DEMAINE: I mean, I
was really happy with how

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:08,840
the class came out.

3
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:13,060
Even though I was learning
the material as I went

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,020
things came together
pretty well.

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,640
There are a couple
of the topics where,

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,240
because I was just learning
as I was teaching it,

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,460
I might have selected the
topics a little differently.

8
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,210
Now that I have a bigger
sense of the picture

9
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,800
I would maybe focus in on
some of the more interesting

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,560
subtopics within--
approximation algorithms

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,790
was one where it's such a
huge field it was hard for me

12
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,430
to learn all of it and then
pick out the best examples.

13
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,080
So I learned a big
part of it and then

14
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,940
picked out some examples.

15
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,820
But I would probably, now that
I have more experience with it,

16
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,992
I would do it a
little differently.

17
00:00:50,992 --> 00:00:53,450
And, of course, there are more
topics that I didn't get to.

18
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:57,890
So next time I teach the class
I'll probably add in a few more

19
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:58,850
additional topics.

20
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,020
And kick out a few
others, which are still

21
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,640
available in video forms,
so they're not gone.
